<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> object in writing this book is to give an account of the
capture of Constantinople and the destruction of the Greek
empire. In order to make the story intelligible and to
explain its significance I have given a summary of the
history of the empire between the Latin conquest in 1204
and the capture of the city in 1453, and have traced the
progress during the same period of the race which succeeded
in destroying the empire and in replacing the Greeks as
the possessors of New Rome.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the task which I have set before
me has already been accomplished by Gibbon, and that, as
his chapter on the last siege of the city is carefully compiled
and written with a brilliancy of style which he has nowhere
surpassed, there is no need for any further study of the
subject. My answer is twofold: first, that an important
mass of new material is now at the disposal of any one who
wishes to retell the story, and second, that Gibbon told it
with a bias which makes it desirable that it should be retold.</p>

<p>The historian of the ‘Decline and Fall’ had less than
half the material before him which is now available, and the
story of the siege deserves telling with more accuracy and
completeness than either the authorities available to him or
the scope of his monumental work permitted. It is true
that Professor J. B. Bury, the latest editor of Gibbon, has,
by the aid of scholarly notes and of careful research, enabled
the reader to become possessed of many of the details
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
regarding the siege which have recently become known, but
he would be the first to admit that there is ample room for
a fuller history of the siege than that given in the ‘Decline
and Fall’ even with the aid of his valuable notes.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Gibbon
himself regretted the poverty of his materials and especially
that he had not been able to obtain any Turkish accounts
of the siege.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The only eye-witnesses whose narratives
were before him were Phrantzes, Archbishop Leonard, and
Cardinal Isidore. If we add to their narratives the accounts
given by Ducas and Chalcondylas together with what Gibbon
himself calls ‘short hints of Cantemir and Leunclavius,’ we
have substantially all the sources of information which were
available when the ‘Decline and Fall’ was written.</p>

<p>The new sources of information regarding the siege
brought to light since Gibbon’s day enable us to gain a
much more complete view of that event and of the character
of its principal actors than was possible at the time when
he wrote. Several Continental writers have taken advantage
of some at least of the new stores of information to rewrite
its story,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> but I may be allowed to claim the good fortune of
being the first Englishman who has even attempted to write
a narrative of that event with the whole or even with any
considerable portion of the new material before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>Before, however, proceeding to indicate what the new
sources of information are, I must say something regarding
the second reason I have assigned why those interested in
the account of an event which marks the end of an epoch of
great traditions and of a civilisation on ancient rather than
on modern lines should not remain satisfied with Gibbon’s
account of it. Though he claimed to examine the authorities
before him with philosophical impartiality, the writers known
to him belonged to the Roman Church, and he was influenced
unconsciously by their representations. These writers wrote
under the influence of the most bitter theological controversies.
They are imbued with a spirit of rancour towards
those Greeks (that is, towards the great majority of the
population) who had not accepted the Union with the Church
of Rome which had been decreed at Florence. Their
testimony throughout their narratives is for the most part
that of violent partisans. But even if Gibbon, when dealing
with the disputes between the great historical Churches, had
been in possession of statements of the Greek case, his
contempt for both Churches was too great to allow him to
do justice to the questions which divided them, questions
which nevertheless, as they prevented the united action of
Europe to resist the Turkish invasion, were among the most
important of the time. His habit of thought as an
eighteenth century theist did not allow him to attach
sufficient weight to the theological aspect of the struggle
between the East and the West. Everything that smelt of
the cloister was hateful. The theological questions themselves
were not worth discussion. The disputants were in
his view narrow-minded, ignorant, and superstitious. The
refinements of the definitions of the Double Procession were
useless, trivial, or ridiculous. Religious zeal or enthusiasm
was a thing to be condemned&mdash;was the mark of fanaticism
and always mischievous. In this attitude of mind Gibbon
was neither better nor worse than the majority of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
philosophical contemporaries. He differed from them in
being able to bequeath to future generations a work of
monumental learning, in which his and their reading of the
progress of Christianity in the Eastern empire was destined
to have a long and deservedly great reputation. His research
and eloquence, his keen sarcasm, his judicial manner, and
the powerful influence of the ‘Decline and Fall’ were employed
to discredit Christianity rather than to try to discover
amid the fierce wranglings of theologians over insoluble
problems what was their signification for the history of the
time of which he was treating and in the development of
the human mind. He began with a period in which the
emperor is worshipped as Divinity and traced the establishment
of Christianity as a national faith among Pagan
subjects until in a diversified form it became accepted by
all; but he did this without affording us any help to see
how the human mind could accept the first position or what
were the movements of thought which led to the evolution
of the questions which agitated men’s minds in the later
period.</p>

<p>The century in which he and his contemporaries lived
was for them one of hostility to Christianity rather than of
investigation, the period of Voltaire, who could only see in
Byzantine history ‘a worthless repertory of declamation
and miracles, disgraceful to the human mind’ rather than
of the Continental and English writers of the modern
historical school. Happily, in the twentieth century those
who look upon Christianity with an independence as
complete as that of Gibbon recognise that insight can only
be obtained by sympathetic investigation, that for the right
understanding of history it is essential to put oneself in the
place of men who have attached importance to a religious
controversy, to consider their environment and examine
their conduct and motives from their point of view, if we
would comprehend either the causes which have led such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
controversy to be regarded as important or the conduct of
the controversialists themselves. The absence in Gibbon of
any sympathetic attempt to understand the controversies
which play so large a part in his great drama of human
history renders him as unsatisfactory a guide in regard to
them as a writer of English history during the period of
Charles the First would be who should merely treat with
contempt the half religious, half political questions which
divided Englishmen. While the objection I have suggested
to Gibbon’s attitude would apply generally to his treatment
of religious questions, I have only to deal with it in reference
to the period of which I am treating. When writing of
this period Gibbon did not realise that the religious question
was nearly always a political one, and that union with Rome
meant subjection to Rome. But unless it be realised how
completely the citizens of Constantinople and the other
great cities of the empire were engrossed with semi-religious
and semi-political questions, no true conception of the life
of the empire can be formed; for these questions were of
interest not merely to Churchmen but to all.</p>

<p>Among the documents brought to light during the last
fifty or sixty years which have contributed to our better
knowledge of the siege the most important are the ‘Diary’
of Nicolo Barbaro and the ‘Life of Mahomet’ by Critobulus.</p>

<p>Barbaro belonged to a noble Venetian family. He was
present in Constantinople throughout the siege, kept a
journal<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> of what he saw and heard, and, though full of
prejudices against Genoese, Greeks, and Turks, contrives
to tell his story in a manner which carries conviction of its
truthfulness. His narrative conveys the impression of an
independent observer who had no object in writing except
to relate what he knew about the siege. While probably
written from day to day, the diary bears internal evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
of having been revised after he had left the city. Its language
is old-fashioned colloquial Venetian and has often
puzzled Italians whom I have called in to my aid.</p>

<p>The original manuscript of the diary was preserved
in Venice by members of the Barbaro family until 1829.
After various adventures it came in 1837 into the possession
of the Imperial and Royal Marciana Library in Venice. In
1854 it was entrusted to Enrico Cornet, and was published
by him for the first time in 1856.</p>

<p>Critobulus, the author of the ‘Life of Mahomet the
Second,’ was a man of a different type. Nothing is known
of him beyond what is contained in his Life of Mahomet.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
He describes himself as ‘Critobulus the Islander.’ After the
capture of Constantinople, when the archons of Imbros,
Lemnos, and Thasos feared that the Turkish admiral would
shortly approach to annex these islands, messengers were
sent to the admiral and succeeded, by offering voluntary
submission and by paying him a large bribe, in avoiding the
general pillage which usually followed a Turkish conquest.
Shortly afterwards, Critobulus took service under the sultan
and was made archon of Imbros. In this capacity he received
the submission of Lemnos and other places. He
continued to hold this office for at least four years. Book
III. of his history contains (<i>inter alia</i>) an account of what
he himself did as the servant of Mahomet. Probably he
went to reside in Constantinople in 1460. His history
covers the first seventeen years of Mahomet’s reign. It is
dedicated to the sultan and is followed by an apology to his
fellow Greeks for having written it. While open to the
charge of not allowing himself an altogether free hand in
revealing the faults and cruelties of his master, Critobulus
claims that he has taken great pains to know the truth of
what he relates. As he wrote a few years after the siege
and at leisure, his narrative does not show the signs of haste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
which mark many of the shorter narratives of that event:
such, for example, as those of Leonard, of the Podestà of
Pera, of Cardinal Isidore in the ‘Lamentatio,’ and of others.
As he continued to belong to the Orthodox Church and to
the Greek as opposed to the Roman party in that Church,
his history is free from the denunciations of his fellow
Christians for having refused the union agreed to at Florence.
The writer’s characteristics as a Greek, but also as a servant
of the sultan, show themselves in his work. He expresses
sympathy with his own people, extols their courage, and
laments their misfortunes. But in places his biography of
the sultan reads like the report of an able and courageous
official. His training and experience in the work of government,
his service under Mahomet, and perhaps something
in the nature of the man, make his narrative sober and
methodical and impress the reader with the idea that the
author felt a sense of responsibility for the truthfulness of
what he was writing. While the narratives of Phrantzes,
Chalcondylas, and Ducas recount some of the incidents of
the siege more fully than that of Critobulus, the latter gives
more details on others and supplies valuable information
which none of them have given. His Life of Mahomet is
by far the most valuable of the recently discovered documents,
and, as will be seen, I have made use of it as the
nucleus of my narrative of the siege.</p>

<p>The manuscript of Critobulus was discovered by the late
Dr. Dethier less than forty years ago in the Seraglio Library
at Constantinople. It was transcribed by him and also by
Herr Karl Müller and was published by the latter in 1883
with valuable notes.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Two other works of importance unknown to Gibbon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
were due respectively to Tetaldi and Pusculus. Each of
these authors took part in the defence of the city. Tetaldi,
who was a Florentine soldier, tells us of his escape from the
slaughter immediately following the capture, and of his
being picked up out of the water by a Venetian ship.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Pusculus was a citizen of Brescia. Though his account
of the siege is given in Latin verse, it contains many details
of value of what he himself saw which are not to be found
elsewhere. His poem was never altogether lost sight of, but
until its publication by Ellisen,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> in 1857, with a useful
introduction, its historical value had not been recognised.
The MS. from which Ellisen made his copy is dated 1470.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Dethier, who devoted much time and intelligent
study to the topography and archæology of Constantinople,
compiled four volumes of documents relating to the
siege, many of which were previously unknown. Two of
them were printed about 1870, but they can hardly be said
to have been published, and are only to be procured with
difficulty. The remaining two contain, besides Critobulus,
the ‘Threnos,’ Hypsilantes, an Italian and a Latin version of
the ‘Lamentatio’ by Cardinal Isidore, an Italian version of
Leonard’s report to the Pope, and other documents of
interest to which I refer in my pages. These volumes were
printed by the Buda-Pest Academy but never published. I
am indebted, however, to that learned body for a copy.</p>

<p>I append a list of documents (other than the four principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
which I have described) relating to the siege now
available to the historical student which were unknown to
Gibbon:</p>

<p class="indent">1. Zorzo (or Zorsi) Dolphin (or Zorsi Dolfin), ‘Assedio e presa
di Constantinopoli nell’ anno 1453.’ This is mainly a
translation from Leonard, but the author claims to have
added what he heard from other eye-witnesses of the
siege. It was published by G. M. Thomas in the ‘Sitzungsberichte’
of the Bavarian Academy in 1868. Another
version is given by Dethier in his collection of documents
relating to the siege, a collection which I refer to simply
as Dethier’s ‘Siege.’</p>

<p class="indent">2. ‘Rapporto del Superiore dei Franciscani presente all’ assedio
e alla presa di Constantinopoli.’ This report was made
immediately after the siege and has long been published,
but apparently was not known to Gibbon. Dethier also
published it in his ‘Siege.’</p>

<p class="indent">3. ‘Epistola Ang. Johannis Zacchariae,’ Podestà of Pera, written
within a month of the capture of the city, was first
published in 1827. The version revised by Edward
Hopf and Dr. Dethier is the one used by me.</p>

<p class="indent">4. Montaldo’s ‘De Constantinopolitano excidio’ is reproduced
in Dethier’s ‘Siege,’ and contains useful hints by an
eye-witness.</p>

<p class="indent">5. Christoforo Riccherio, ‘La Presa de Constantinopoli,’ first
published in Sansovino’s ‘Dell’ Historia Universale,’
was republished with notes in Dethier’s ‘Siege,’ and is a
valuable and brightly written narrative.</p>

<p class="indent">6. Θρῆνος τῆς Κωνσταντινουπόλεως, was first published by Ellisen
in ‘Analekten,’ Leipzig, 1857. If the author was in
Constantinople during the siege, he has not given a single
item of information which is of value to the historian.
His long wail is curious and interesting, but otherwise
useless.</p>

<p class="indent">7. The Θρῆνος of Hierax the Grand Logothetes, or ‘History of
the Turkish Empire,’ though only written near the end
of the sixteenth century, has valuable topographical hints.
It was translated by H. E. Aristarchi Bey, the present
Grand Logothetes, from a MS. existing in the Monastery of
the Holy Sepulchre at the Phanar, and edited by Dethier.</p>

<p class="indent">8. ‘Libro d’ Andrea Cambini Florentino della Origine de’ Turchi
et Imperio delli Ottomanni.’ I am not aware whether
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
this has been published at a later date than the copy in
my possession, which was printed in Florence in 1529.
It was then published by the son of the writer, and
Book II., which treats of the siege, suggests that the
author has gained his information from spectators of the
siege. It contains many useful statements.</p>

<p class="indent">9. ‘A Slavic Account of the Siege,’ published by Streznevski,
is judged by Monsieur Mijatovich, on account of its
peculiar idioms, to have been written by a Serbian or
Bulgarian. He speaks of it as the ‘Slavonic Chronicle.’
A translation and a slightly different version was published
by Dethier as the ‘Muscovite Chronicle.’ Though
the narrative has been largely added to by subsequent
hands, there is reason to believe that it was written by an
eye-witness of the siege.</p>

<p class="indent">10. Another Slavic version is conveniently spoken of as the
‘Memoirs of the Polish Janissary.’ Its author, after
serving with the Turks and, according to his own statement,
being present at the siege, withdrew to Poland.
The original MS. was first published in 1828.</p>

<p>The Turkish authors available who speak of the siege are:</p>

<p class="indent">11. Sad-ud-din, ‘The Capture of Constantinople from the Tajut-Tevarikh
(1590),’ translated into English by E. J. W.
Gibb (Glasgow, 1879). This work professes to be based
on the accounts of earlier Turkish historians.</p>

<p class="indent">12. ‘Tarich Muntechebati Evliya Chelibi,’ a translation of which
is given in the elder Mordtmann’s ‘Eroberung.’</p>

<p class="indent">13. Ahmed Muktar Pasha’s ‘Conquest of Constantinople and
the Establishment of the Ottomans in Europe,’ brought
out only in 1902, on the anniversary of the present
sultan’s accession.</p>

<p class="indent">14. An Armenian ‘Mélodie Élégiaque,’ written by a monk
named Philip, who was present at the siege. This was
printed in Lebeau’s ‘Histoire du Bas-Empire.’ Dethier
published the original version in Armenian.</p>

<p>I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Mordtmann’s
studies of the archæology and topography of Constantinople,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
and to Professor A. van Millingen’s ‘Byzantine
Constantinople’<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> a work which is the most careful study of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
the history of those parts of the walls and other portions of
the city treated of which has yet been published. I must
also tender him sincere thanks for many suggestions made in
the course of friendly intercourse and in the discussion of
matters of mutual archæological interest, and for permission
to reproduce his map of Constantinople. All future
writers on the topography and archaeology of Constantinople
will be under obligations to Dr. Mordtmann and Professor
van Millingen, who have worthily continued the work of
Gyllius and Du Cange.</p>

<p>A few words must be added as to the title of this book.
Why, it may be asked, should it be the ‘Destruction of the
Greek Empire’? Why not follow the example of the late
Mr. Freeman, and of his distinguished successor, Professor
J. B. Bury, and speak of the ‘Later Roman Empire’? My
plea is one of confession and avoidance.</p>

<p>I admit that when Charles the Great, in 800, became
Roman Emperor in the West the imperial territory of which
the capital was Constantinople may correctly be spoken of
as the Eastern Roman Empire. But I avoid condemnation
for not adopting this name and for not calling the empire
Roman by pleading that I am reverting to the practice
of our fathers in the West during many centuries, and by
defending their practice. The Empire has sometimes been
described as Byzantine and sometimes as the Lower Empire.
But these names are undesirable, because the first has a
vague and doubtful meaning, since no two writers who
employ it use it to cover the same period; and the second
has a derogatory signification which the researches of
Freeman and Professor Bury, Krumbacher, Schlumberger,
and other modern writers, have shown to be undeserved.
The name ‘Roman’ has more to recommend it. The Persians
and the Arabs knew the empire simply as Roman, and the
overwhelming reputation of Rome led them to speak even
of Alexander the Great as ‘Iskender al Roumy.’ The name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
of Rome, or Roum, given to Roumelia, and found in other
places as far east as Erzeroum, had been applied when the
Latin element dominated the empire. The tradition of
Rome passed on to the Turks, and the inhabitants of the
empire were and are to them I-roum or Romans. The
Byzantine writers usually called themselves Romans. But
the term Roman can hardly be applied to the empire
without distinguishing it as Eastern, and while it is true
that down to 1453 the empire was Roman in name, there
is some danger in employing the term of forgetting how far
the New Rome and its territory had become Hellenised,
and that a large portion of the population preferred the
name Greek. There had been a long struggle within the
empire itself between those who wished to adopt the latter
designation and those who desired to call it Roman. The
inhabitants of Greece were indeed for centuries preceding
and during the Crusades disloyal subjects of Constantinople.
Even during the reign of Heraclius (610 to 641), they
insisted upon being called Hellenes rather than Romans.
From that time onwards a contest was continued as to
whether the name of Greek or Roman should be applied to
the population. The influence of the Greeks henceforth was
constantly working to Hellenise the empire. In the reign
of Irene, at the time when the Western Roman Empire
commenced to have a separate existence, Greek influence
was especially strong. Lascaris, four centuries later, when
he made his stand at Nicaea after the Latin conquest,
spoke of the empire as that of Hellas. On the recovery
of the city under Michael, the Church generally employed
the term Roman, but declared that Greek and Roman might
be employed indifferently. Various writers speak of the
Latins as Romans and of the Byzantines as Hellenes.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
Manuel Bryennius represents the preacher in St. Sophia as
calling upon his hearers to remember their Greek ancestors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
and to defend their country as they had done. At times the
people were appealed to as the descendants alike of Greeks
and Romans.</p>

<p>As being a continuation of the Roman Empire whose
capital was New Rome, the empire is correctly called
Roman, and the name has the advantage of always keeping
in view the continuity of Roman history. It was the
Eastern Roman Empire which declined and fell in 1453.
But if we admit that the empire continued to be Roman
till 1453, it must be remembered, not only that its characteristics
had considerably changed, but that to the men of
the West it had come to be known as the Greek Empire.
Latin had been as completely forgotten as Norman French
was by English nobles in the time of Edward III. Greek
had become the official language, as did English in our own
country. The inscriptions on the coins since the time of
Heraclius are in Greek. The Orthodox Church, which aided
as much as even law in binding the inhabitants of the
country together, employed Greek, and Greek almost exclusively,
as its language, and, although the great defenders of
the term Roman as applied to the population are found
among its dignitaries, the Church was essentially Greek
as opposed to Roman, both in the character of its thought
and teaching and in the language it employed. Hence it
is not surprising that to the West during all the middle
ages, the Empire was the Greek Empire, just as the
Orthodox Church was the Greek Church.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The Empire and
the Church were each alike called Greek to distinguish them
from the Empire and Church of the West. It is in this
general use of the word Greek that I find my justification
for speaking of the capture of Constantinople, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
events connected with it, as the Destruction of the Greek
Empire.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>I have only in conclusion to call the attention of the
reader to one or two matters connected with the authorities
which I quote. I must plead that my residence in Constantinople
has not allowed me to refer to the uniform series
of Byzantine authors available in the great public libraries
of Western Europe. My edition of Phrantzes is that published
in the Bonn series; Pachymer, Cantacuzenus, Chalcondylas,
Ducas, and their contemporaries, are quoted from
the Venetian edition of the Byzantine writers edited by
Du Cange. My references to Archbishop Leonard are
almost always to the version in the collection of Lonicerus.
Dr Dethier, however, published a contemporary Italian
version which has certain important variations, and to this
I have occasionally referred. The editors of other authorities
are mentioned in the notes to the text.</p>

<p>I have sometimes abstained from discussing the trustworthiness
of my authorities, but have said once for all that
their statements, especially in regard to the numbers they
represent as engaged in battle, of victims slaughtered or
captured, and the like, can rarely be regarded as satisfactory.
The means of controlling them seldom exist. Even in the
case of Sir John Maundeville, I have quoted him without
hinting that a doubt of his very existence has been uttered.
Whether he lived and was or was not a traveller, or whether
his book was, as has been suggested, a kind of mediæval Murray’s
Guide, does not in the least affect the statements which
I have reproduced from it. The work of sifting the evidence,
new and old, to ascertain its value has been long and tedious,
and I must leave to other students of the same period to say
whether I have succeeded in selecting what is of use and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
in rejecting only what is valueless. To have attempted a
critical examination of every important statement which I
quote would have extended my book to an inordinate length,
and in regard to most of them the reader will not find much
difficulty in arriving at his own conclusions as to their trustworthiness.</p>

THE GREEK EMPIRE</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>CHAPTER I</h2></div>

<p class="center f08">THE LATIN EMPIRE (1204–1261) AND ITS STRUGGLES WITH
AND FINAL OVERTHROW BY THE GREEKS OF NICAEA</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> later Roman Empire and its capital Constantinople
never recovered from the blow inflicted by the Fourth Crusade
in 1204. A huge filibustering expedition had been
gathered together at Venice under pretext of making an
attack upon the Saracens in Egypt. Under the leadership
of Boniface, Marquis of Montferrat, and Dandolo, the famous
doge of Venice, the expedition had been diverted from its
purpose, and, in spite of the strongest possible protests by
Innocent the Third, had attacked Constantinople. The
strength of the empire had been weakened by a hundred
and fifty years’ resistance to the hordes of Asia, during
which it had served as the bulwark of Europe. Its reputation
had been lessened by thirty years of dynastic wars,
during which the government had allowed its fleet to decay
so that it was unable to resist the Venetians and Crusaders.
The result was that, for the first time in its long history, the
city was captured. There then followed the plunder and
division of its enormous wealth&mdash;a large part of which found
its way to the West, while perhaps a still larger portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
was destroyed&mdash;the appointment of a Latin emperor in
Constantinople, and the partition of such portions of the
empire as could be occupied among the conquerors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baldwin,
1204–1205.</div>

<p>Baldwin, a Belgian, was elected emperor. An arrangement
for the division of the spoil had been made by the
leaders before the attack on the city, and this seems to
have been fairly carried out. To Baldwin were assigned the
two imperial palaces in Constantinople and one fourth of all
that should be captured within the city and throughout the
empire. The remaining three fourths were to be divided
equally between the Crusaders and the Venetians. The
difficulties of the conquerors began with this further division
of the spoil. The task of parcelling out the empire was
almost hopeless.<span class="sidenote">Difficulties
regarding
division of
empire.</span> It was next to impossible to accomplish
such a partition, even on paper, because of the ignorance of
the Western conquerors of the empire they had destroyed.
Its extent was so great, the difficulty of communication so
extreme, and ignorance of geography so profound, that the
conquerors did not know what there was to divide. They
sent into the provinces to obtain information as to the
revenues and general condition of the country so that the
partition might be fairly made; but, without waiting for the
information, they proceeded to divide up the countries and
provinces which they imagined to be within the empire. In
their happy ignorance they drew lots for Alexandria and for
the various countries along the north shore of the Mediterranean
as well as for Georgia, Persia, and Assyria. They
competed for the possession of Konia itself, the capital of
the Seljukian Turks.</p>

<p>It was still more difficult to make a partition which
should represent territory which could come at once into
the occupation of the Crusaders. The one system of land
tenure with which they were acquainted was the feudal.
The lands of the empire must therefore be divided into fiefs
and the barons and persons of higher and of lower degree
must have grants according to their rank. But though
Constantinople was in the possession of the men of the
West, they held no more of the remainder of the empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
than was within the actual sight of the barons and the
comparatively small bodies of retainers who were under
them. The Greeks&mdash;or, as the subjects of the later empire
still generally called themselves, the Romans&mdash;had no intention
of recognising either the lordship of the barons who
had become their feudal superiors or the overlordship of
Baldwin. They knew nothing of a feudal system, and
recognised the representatives of the late empire as having
a first claim to their service. They were ready to follow
almost any leader against men whom they knew only as
invaders, belonging to a different race, speaking a different
language, and professing a form of Christianity which was
hateful to them because the conquerors tried to impose it
upon them.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the Latin empire were both internal
and external.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissensions
among
leaders.</div>

<p>The men from the West soon found that they were too
few to hold the country. Some of the Crusaders had
insisted upon leaving the city in order to proceed to the
Holy Land in fulfilment of their vows and to avoid the
censure of Innocent. Others were anxious to return home
with their share of the spoils. ‘Never since the world was
created,’ says Villehardouin the historian, who took an active
part in the capture of the city, ‘was there so much booty
gained in one city. Each man took the house which pleased
him, and there were enough for all. Those who were poor
found themselves suddenly rich.’ If they remained they
had hardships to face which as the possessors of newly
obtained wealth they would rather avoid. As soon as new
dangers appeared the numbers of those who wished to get
away increased. During the very first year of Baldwin’s
reign, his army on its retreat from an expedition against the
Bulgarians found at Rodosto seven thousand men at arms
who had quitted the capital and were leaving the country.
It was in vain that a cardinal and the leaders sent by the
army, among whom was Villehardouin himself, implored
them even with tears to remain, for ‘Never,’ said these
leaders, ‘would they be able to succour a country in so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
great a need.’<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> The most favourable answer that they
could obtain was that a reply would be given on the morrow.
The deserters set sail in the night without even giving the
promised response to the prayer made to them.</p>

<p>The internal difficulties were increased by the jealousy
which existed between the leaders of the Latins themselves.
All through the journey to Constantinople before the capture
of the city, the Crusaders and Venetians had mistrusted each
other. Boniface, the leader of the Crusade, considered
himself ill treated because he had not been named emperor.
Though defeated, he had a large number of adherents. To
him had been assigned territory in Asia Minor. He applied
to exchange it for the kingdom of Salonica, alleging that as
he had married the widow of the Emperor Isaac, who was
the sister of the King of Hungary, he would be at Salonica
in a better position to aid the emperor. His request was
granted. Baldwin, however, did not trust him, and, apparently
under the impression that it was the intention of
Boniface to establish an independent sovereignty, insisted
on accompanying him to his newly acquired capital. To
this course Boniface objected so strongly that when the
emperor started for Salonica, Boniface not only refused to
accompany him but went off towards Adrianople, captured
Didymotica, and laid siege to the former city. The Greeks
flocked to his standard, possibly being induced to do so by
the belief that as he had married the widow of Isaac he was
entitled to their allegiance.</p>

<p>As soon as Dandolo, Count Louis, and the other nobles
who had remained in Constantinople heard what Marquis
Boniface was doing, they at once took counsel in ‘parlement’
as to the measures to be adopted: ‘for,’ says Villehardouin,
‘they thought that they would lose all the conquests they
had made.’ They decided to send a knight to Boniface
without delay, and the historian was himself chosen for the
mission. He went at once to Adrianople and succeeded in
persuading the marquis to submit the questions between him
and the emperor to the arbitration of Dandolo and Count
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Louis, and for the present to cease hostilities. Meantime the
emperor had occupied Salonica. As soon as he heard of the
siege of Adrianople he at once hastened to its relief and
‘pour faire tout le mal qu’il pourrait au marquis.’ On the
way he met the messengers from the city, who besought
him to submit his case, as Boniface had consented to do, to
arbitration, at the same time plainly telling him that
Dandolo, Count Louis of Blois, and the other barons would
not tolerate war between him and Boniface. The emperor
hesitated and consulted his council. Some of the members
urged that the message was an outrage and advised resistance.
Violent language (‘grosses paroles’) was used, but
the emperor, who was unwilling to risk the hostility of so
strong a combination as Dandolo and Louis, gave way to the
extent of stating that he would undertake not to attack
Boniface until he went to Constantinople, although he would
not pledge himself to refer the questions between them to
arbitration. Shortly after, when a peace was patched up
between them, it was under conditions which show that
neither party trusted the other. Villehardouin undertook to
hold Didymotica until he knew by a trusted messenger that
Salonica had been handed over to Boniface.</p>

<p>Nor were the external differences which at once presented
themselves less serious. The history of Constantinople
and the Latin empire during the period between 1204
and 1260 is indeed that of a series of struggles between
Baldwin and his successors on the imperial throne, on the
one side, and the leaders of the Greek race who had refused
to recognise the authority of the invaders, on the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition
of Greek
population.</div>

<p>The Western barons seemed to have thought that with
the conquest of the capital the whole empire would fall to
their lot. They were soon undeceived. In Macedonia and
in Epirus Greek leaders appeared, who rallied to them all
who were indisposed to accept new rulers. At Trebizond on
the Black Sea, and at Nicaea, the once famous city of the
Creed, the Greeks flocked from the capital and its neighbourhood,
and soon there were rulers of these cities who assumed
the title of emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Empire of
Nicaea.
Theodore
Lascaris,
1204–1222.</div>

<p>The most important of those who refused to accept the
Latin rule was Theodore Lascaris. He had been the last of
the Greek nobles to leave the city when the invaders
captured it. He made his way to Nicaea, and was followed
by many Greeks. Able, courageous, and patriotic, he was
soon recognised by the notables as the fittest man to have
rule among them, and, though without hereditary claim to the
imperial throne, he aspired to be emperor and was accepted
as best suited to receive that dignity. Two years after the
capture of Constantinople, a new patriarch was elected, who
consented to live at Nicaea and who amid as much ceremony
as if the coronation had taken place in St. Sophia
placed the crown on the head of Theodore in the church of
the same name at Nicaea. The prudence and judgment of
the new emperor did much to rally the best of his countrymen
around him, and justified the choice made in electing
him to the imperial throne. The Greek priests flocked to
the city from all parts of Western Asia Minor as well as
from Thrace.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his task was beset with difficulties. He
had enemies on all sides, pretenders of his own race, the
Latin emperor and the sultan of the Seljukian Turks.
The latter, whose capital was at Konia, had no idea of
allowing any neighbour to become formidable. A Greek
pretender held the country to the west of Nicaea. The
Latin emperor and barons chose to regard Theodore as a
rebel because he would not make submission. After unsuccessful
attempts against him by Baldwin and his successor,
Theodore was allowed in 1207 to remain in possession of
Ismidt (the ancient Nicomedia) and Cyzicus for a period of
two years. He employed the period in strengthening and
extending his empire. At the end of it, Henry the brother
of Baldwin, whom he succeeded as emperor, made an alliance
with the sultan of the Seljukian Turks: that is to say, the
Crusaders who had justified themselves to Innocent the
Third for attacking a Christian city on the ground that the
Greek emperors had allowed the Moslems to have a mosque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
within the city, now found themselves under the necessity of
joining forces with the infidel to attack a Christian prince.</p>

<p>Upon the declaration of war by the sultan, Theodore
pushed forward into the valley of the Meander, and a battle
was fought which, if the Byzantine authorities are to be
trusted, was decided in single combat between the two
sovereigns. The sultan was killed, and the empire of Nicaea
was saved. The Emperor Henry, however, when he heard
of the extent of the loss in Theodore’s army exclaimed,
‘The Greek is not conqueror: he is ruined.’</p>

<p>So far from being ruined, his success caused many
Greeks to flock into his empire from Constantinople. When,
in 1214, the Emperor Henry again declared war, Theodore
was ready for him; and as the Greeks in Epirus had
commenced a vigorous attack on the crusading barons in
Macedonia, Henry was glad to make a peace which left
Theodore undisputed master of a territory bounded on the
west by a line from Heraclea on the Black Sea to Ismidt,
thence to Cyzicus and to the coast just north of Pergamos.
The fruitful valleys of the Meander, the Cayster, and the
Hermus marked his boundaries on the south-west.</p>

<p>Theodore died in 1222. The first duty of the Greeks
when driven out of Constantinople was to make themselves
secure against the conquerors and to prevent the progress of
the crusading armies into Asia Minor. This duty had been
effectually done by Theodore. During the eighteen years
of his reign he had made his capital and its beautiful neighbourhood
the rallying-place of what was best in the Greek-speaking
populations of Asia Minor and of Thrace. He had
checked the progress of the crusaders into Asia Minor and
had left to his successors the task of working for the recovery
of Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry
succeeds
Baldwin,
1205–1216.</div>

<p>Meantime, the history of the Latin conquerors of Constantinople
had been one of almost continuous disaster.
The first Emperor Baldwin had been lost in an encounter
with the Bulgarians near Adrianople in April 1205, and
was probably killed. As his fate remained doubtful, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
brother Henry acted as regent for a year and was then
crowned emperor. Shortly after the commencement of
his reign in 1207, Boniface, Marquis of Montferrat and
King of Salonica, was killed in a skirmish. Henry seems
to have realised that in a policy of conciliation towards the
Greeks lay the only hope of the continuance of his empire.
He made peace with the Bulgarians and concluded an arrangement
with both the emperor of Nicaea and the Greek
prince who had made himself recognised as despot in Epirus.
He employed Greeks in the public service. He refused to
take part in the persecution of the Greeks who would not
obey the decrees of the pope’s legate. He allowed them to
employ the Greek language in their services, and restrained
the pretensions of the Roman priests. Unfortunately for
the Latin empire, the reign of the chivalrous Henry lasted
only ten years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peter
succeeds,
1217–1219.</div>

<p>He was succeeded by Peter of Courtenay, who was
invited by the barons to occupy the throne in the absence
of male heirs of Baldwin and his brother Henry. Peter left
France with 140 knights and 5,500 men at arms, whom he
had obtained with the aid of his royal kinsman, Philip
Augustus. The reports of the rich plunder which had been
obtained in the capture of the city had already induced
many French knights to leave their native lands to take
service in the empire, but the detachment with which Peter
crossed the Alps was the largest which had left the West
for such purpose.</p>

<p>The Venetians bargained to transport them across the
Adriatic on condition that they would assist in recovering
Durazzo from Theodore, the Greek despot of Epirus. After
a useless assault on that city, Peter started with his followers
on a journey across the peninsula to Salonica. He and his
host were soon lost amid the mountains of Epirus. Their
provisions were exhausted. They found the passes fortified,
and their only chance of life was to surrender to Theodore,
who had held the country in defiance of the regent who was
governing in the name of the son of Boniface. Peter was
detained in captivity, and his death is as mysterious as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of the first Latin emperor. He probably perished in prison
in 1218.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Robert,
1219–1228.</div>

<p>Peter’s successor, Robert of Courtenay, succeeded in
finding his way to Constantinople, though not across Macedonia,
accompanied by a number of troops furnished at the
request of Pope Honorius the Third. His reign was a series
of disasters. He made a treaty of peace with Theodore of
Nicaea in order that he might devote all his attention to the
defeat of the other Theodore, the despot of Epirus. The
latter had been denounced by the pope for his detention of
Peter and of the legate who accompanied him. Honorius
indeed had invited the princes of the West to undertake a
crusade for their deliverance. When, however, the legate
was released, Peter seems to have been forgotten. The
despot Theodore made a well-concerted attack upon Salonica,
captured it, and was proclaimed emperor in 1222. Robert
led all his forces against this new claimant for the imperial
title and was badly beaten. Theodore pushed on to Adrianople
and hoisted his standard on the walls of that city almost
without opposition.</p>

<p>There were thus in 1222 four persons claiming to be
emperors, and occupying separate portions of what had
been twenty years earlier the Roman Empire in the East.
These were Robert at Constantinople, Theodore at Nicaea,
another Theodore at Salonica, and Alexis at Trebizond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nicaea,
success of
John Ducas
Vataces,
1222–1254.</div>

<p>The history of the next forty years (1222–1261) is that
of the strengthening of the Greek empire at Nicaea and
the decadence and downfall of the other so-called empires,
and especially of that of the Latin Crusaders in Constantinople.
The successor of Theodore Lascaris was John Ducas
Vataces, who during a reign of thirty-three years fortified
his position at Nicaea and increased the prosperity of his
empire. He restricted the boundaries of the Latin territory
in Asia Minor to the peninsula formed by a line parallel to
the Bosporus from Ismidt to the Black Sea. He rendered
property and life safe, and in consequence the Greek population
continued to flock into his territory. Even French
soldiers in considerable numbers quietly slipped away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Constantinople to take service with Vataces. At the commencement
of his reign he was attacked by the newly
appointed emperor, Robert of Courtenay, and in the combat
which ensued not only was Vataces successful, but the
last of the knights who had taken part in the capture
of the city were left dead on the field. Until Robert’s
death in 1228, Nicaea had few troubles with the Latin
empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Latin
empire.
John of
Brienne,
1228–1237.
Baldwin
II.,
1237–1261.</div>

<p>Robert’s successor was a boy of eleven, who continued
nominally emperor under the title of Baldwin the Second
for upwards of thirty years, but the Latin knights wisely
placed power in the hands of John de Brienne. Indeed, the
crusading leaders seem throughout the whole Latin occupation
to have assumed a large measure of the imperial
authority. The period is contemporary with that of the
barons who resisted King John in England, and who continued
to assert their independence under the reign of Henry
the Third. The French barons in Constantinople had much
of the same spirit, with the additional incentive to independence
that, as the emperors were of recent creation, the
glamour which had already gathered about the kingly office
in England and France was absent. The emperor was
indeed nothing more than <i>primus inter pares</i>, and his own
designs were often set aside for those of his associates.
No one can doubt that they acted wisely in appointing
John de Brienne, but even he, with all his experience and
caution, failed as his predecessor had done when he attacked
Nicaea.</p>

<p>The courage and ability of the old Crusader, who was
already eighty years of age, hardly retarded the decay of
the Latin empire. Its needs were great, and accordingly
Baldwin the Second was sent on a visit to the pope and
to the Western courts to obtain further supplies of men
and money. Indeed, the greater part of his reign was
<span class="sidenote">Baldwin
visits
France,</span>
occupied by three of such journeys. His first visit to
France was in 1237. Hardly had he arrived in Paris
when he learned the death of John de Brienne. The
messenger who brought the tidings told a terrible story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the distress in the imperial city. The barons and soldiers<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
dared not venture outside the walls. The supply of food
had run so short that many of the gentlemen of France
who were charged with its defence disguised themselves
and escaped by sea or, notwithstanding that the country
was full of dangers, endeavoured to make their way by
land to their own country. The peril was so great that
Baldwin was assured that if aid were not sent the city could
not resist an attack. Upon these tidings Baldwin did his
utmost to obtain aid. He was received with honour wherever
he went, but he received little else. In 1238, he paid
a visit to England. On his landing at Dover he was asked
<span class="sidenote">and
England.</span>
how he presumed to enter the country without the permission
of its independent sovereign, Henry the Third.
Henry had had enough trouble with Crusaders. John de
Brienne, who had been in England, had obtained aid from
the king and had been honourably received. On his return
to France he had joined with Philip Augustus against
England. Henry, however, sent word to Baldwin that as
he had arrived without troops he might come on to London.
After receiving this permission he paid a visit to the king
and finally left England with the miserable sum of seven
hundred marks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pope supports
Latin
empire.</div>

<p>The pope had taken Baldwin’s cause greatly to heart.
He enjoined all Christian princes to give him aid. He
ordered the leading archbishops of the West to publish a
new Crusade against the Greek schismatics. He directed
part of the Peter’s pence to be given for the furtherance of
the Crusade and ordered that the money which St. Louis
with pious zeal had extorted from the Jews as obtained by
usury should be employed for the same purpose. He begged
the king to direct that one third of the revenues of the
churches should be thus employed, and he wrote to the king
of England with a similar request. In 1238 John de
Bethune started from France with men and money. The
expedition, however, came to grief. Its leader died at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Venice and the army melted away, very few ever arriving at
the Bosporus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decay of
Latin
empire.</div>

<p>The character of the news from Constantinople continued
constantly to be more and more distressing. The
revenue was yearly decreasing. The money obtained in
Europe was already spent, and the knights were driven to
desperate expedients to obtain more. Copper was torn from
the domes of the churches and other public buildings to be
converted into coin. Empty houses were pulled down to
supply fuel. The sacred relics, which in the eyes of the
Crusaders constituted not only the most valuable treasures
of the city but the talisman of its safety, were sold to meet
pressing needs.<span class="sidenote">Sale of
relics.</span> The Sacred Crown of Thorns had been
pledged for a sum of about seven thousand pounds, and
when the time came for redeeming it, the Latins were not
able to find the money. A Venetian endeavoured to obtain
it in order to add to the prosperity of the Bride of the Seas,
but Baldwin, possibly out of gratitude to Saint Louis of
France, and with the object of obtaining a larger sum, preferred
that it should be sent to France. After considerable
difficulty and many negotiations, the sacred relic was
redeemed and taken with solemn procession from Venice to
Paris, where the king himself, clothed in penitential garments
and barefoot, went out to meet it and to accompany
it to its temporary resting-place. This was in 1239. Baldwin
received from Louis, in recompense of his labour to
obtain so valuable a prize, the sum of ten thousand marks.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only relic which the crusading empire
was obliged to convert into money. A large portion of the
true cross, the lance, the sponge, and other objects, the parting
with which must have cost Baldwin and his barons many a
regret, were also sent to France in order to raise money.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>By July 1239 Baldwin had collected in the West all the
money and forces available and started for Constantinople.
The number of his army was greatly exaggerated by the
rumours which preceded it and greatly alarmed the Greeks
at Nicaea. He arrived at Constantinople at the end of
<span class="sidenote">Prosperity
of Nicene
empire.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>December. John Vataces, in consequence of these rumours
and as a precaution, allied himself with the Bulgarians.
The armies of the two states attacked Constantinople. The
Venetians saved the city by arriving in time to make it
necessary to raise the siege. Then the Bulgarians made
friends with the Latins and allowed a band of Comans (or
Tur-comans) who had been driven over the Danube by the
Mongols to pass through Bulgaria and take service with the
Latins. The emperor of Nicaea could, however, play a
similar game, and he induced a band of the same race, who
formed excellent light cavalry, to settle on the banks of the
Meander and in Phrygia.</p>

<p>John Vataces succeeded, partly by force, partly by persuasion,
in inducing the despot of Salonica to abandon the
title of emperor and to recognise Nicaea as the true representative
of the former empire of Constantine. Vataces
thereupon became acknowledged ruler of the kingdom of
Salonica from the Aegean to the Adriatic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decay of
Constantinople.</div>

<p>Meantime the wealth and population of Constantinople
were diminishing every day. Its commerce had almost gone.
What was left was in the hands of the Venetians. No
taxes could be levied on the poverty-stricken population.
The Greeks of the country around Constantinople, who had
been the food-producers and the source of revenue to the
merchants of the capital, fled from the constant harass of
war and invasions, now by Latins, now by Bulgarians, and
now by Greeks, into Asia Minor, where they could labour in
the fields or trade in peace and quietness.</p>

<p>The population in other parts of the country were in like
straits. The continual money difficulties among the Latin
knights and the Crusaders generally caused a widespread
spirit of lawlessness. Necessity compelled them to live on
the country they were passing through, and wherever they
were under the command of a weak ruler, pillage was common
and almost unchecked. Before men thus lawless, poor
peasants fled in alarm across the Marmora to be not only
among their own people but where life and property were
secure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>As illustrating the lawlessness among the Latin nobles,
a story told of the Emperor Robert himself is significant.
He was engaged to marry the daughter of Vataces, a marriage
which promised obvious advantages to the Latin
empire. He preferred, however, a lady who was affianced
to a knight of Burgundy. Her mother had acquiesced in
her throwing over her <i>fiancé</i> in favour of the young emperor.
The Burgundian and his friends forced their way into the
palace, threw the mother into the sea, and brutally disfigured
the face of the girl. The barons approved of the deed, and
the king went whining to the pope to condemn the wrong-doers,
since he himself was powerless to avenge the insult
offered to him.</p>

<p>Under such conditions of lawlessness, capital fled the
country. The Latin government had once more to resort
to every possible device for raising money, and the ornaments
of the churches and other public buildings were sent
to the melting-pot or to auction.</p>

<p>While disaster and decay marked the condition of things
in Constantinople, Nicaea continued to increase in prosperity.
The city itself, in a healthy situation on the beautiful
lake of Ascanius, had under the rule of John Vataces
already become wealthy. Taxes were light because the
revenue was not squandered, and the emperor had carried
into the public expenditure the same habits of carefulness
which he displayed in the management of his own private
estates. It is recorded of him, as an illustration of his thrift,
that on presenting the empress with a coronet decked with
jewels he explained to her that it had been bought with
money exclusively obtained from the sale of eggs produced
on his own estates. He paid especial attention to agriculture,
and, though distinguished as a warrior, set the example
of attending personally to his farm, his flocks and herds, the
cultivation of his fields, and the welfare of his labourers.
We may excuse his sumptuary laws for the reason that the
object was to check the luxury of the nobles and to encourage
home manufactures. When he died, in 1254, after
a reign of thirty-three years, Nicaea had deservedly obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the reputation of being the chief city of all Greek-speaking
people, whether in Europe or in Asia, the city to which the
people lifted up their eyes in confidence of a speedy return
to the queen city on the shores of the Bosporus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theodore
II. of
Nicaea,
1254–1258.</div>

<p>The reign of Theodore Lascaris the Second, son of John
Vataces, lasted only four years, and though he lacked the
ability of his father, and was a sufferer from epilepsy, the
empire of Nicaea continued to prosper. His military administration
was able and successful. He continued the policy
of Vataces in endeavouring to induce or to compel all the
Greeks in the Balkan peninsula to come under his rule.
It may be fairly said of him that on his death, in 1258, the
position of Nicaea was stronger than on his accession.</p>

<p>During these two prosperous reigns in the Greek empire
that of the Crusaders had continued to go from bad to
worse. In spite of the anathemas of the popes against
those who should attack Constantinople, the Bulgarians and
the Greeks made war upon it whenever they thought the
opportunity favourable. In spite of the exhortation of the
popes to Western Europe to furnish men and money, and of
the fact that both were furnished, the empire grew weaker
in men and its financial situation became worse.</p>

<p>We have seen that Baldwin returned to Constantinople
with an army which is said to have numbered 30,000 men,
and which in any case was sufficiently large to alarm the
Nicene emperor. But these reinforcements seem to have
been a burden rather than an advantage, and the chief of
the crusading empire had to shock Christian Europe by
consenting to give his niece in marriage to the sultan of
Konia in order to secure an alliance with him against the
Greek emperor.
<span class="sidenote">Second
visit of
Baldwin
to West.</span>Baldwin’s necessities again compelled him
to visit France. He was once more received with honour,
and at the Council of Lyons, in 1245, he was given the
position of supreme honour, and was placed on the right
hand of the pope. All, indeed, that the sovereign pontiff
could accomplish in favour of his guest in this Council was
done. An alliance which the Emperor Frederick had made
with John Vataces was denounced, and the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Holy Roman Empire was solemnly excommunicated. While
nothing was said about the alliance with the Seljukian
Turk, Frederick was condemned for allowing his daughter to
be married to a schismatic Greek. Large sums were ordered
to be contributed by the dignitaries of the Church and by
the religious orders for the succour of the empire. St.
Louis again gave Baldwin a welcome, and entertained him
at his court during nearly two years while aid was being
collected. The pope gave power to absolve from sins those
who should join the Crusade or contribute to the support of
the empire. But, as Matthew Paris says, his empire
nevertheless daily decayed. It was not till 1248 that Baldwin
returned to his impoverished capital. Perhaps the lowest
depth of degradation was attained by him when in 1259 his
necessity was so great that he was obliged to put his only
son in pledge to certain Venetian nobles as security for the
payment of what he had borrowed. The unfortunate lad
was taken to Venice, and his father was unable to redeem
him until after the recapture of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Before the death, in 1258, of Theodore Lascaris the
Second, the ruler of Nicaea was acknowledged emperor, not
merely throughout the northern part of Asia Minor, but in the
kingdom of Macedonia, and even in a considerable portion
of Thrace.<span class="sidenote">John Ducas
Emperor
of Nicaea,
1258–1260.</span> His successor, John, was a boy. John’s guardian
was Michael Palaeologus, who was proclaimed emperor in
January 1259–60. Seeing that there was some disorder in
Nicaea, occasioned by the disputes between those in favour
of the boy, who, in the ordinary course of succession, would
have been emperor, and those who had recognised that the
times were too critical to allow him to reign, and had
<span class="sidenote">Michael Palaeologus.</span>consequently followed Michael, the Latin emperor, Baldwin,
judged the moment opportune to stipulate for concessions.
Accordingly he sent a mission to Nicaea to learn what
Michael would give in order to avoid war. The historian
Acropolitas, who was at Nicaea at the time, records what
passed. The emperor mocked the ambassadors. They
asked that he should surrender Salonica. The reply was
that that city was the emperor’s birthplace; how could he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
part with it? They suggested Seres. The emperor responded
that what they were asking was neither just nor
decent, since he had received it from his father. ‘Give us,
then, Bolero.’ But that was the emperor’s hunting-ground,
and could not be spared. ‘What, then, will you give us?’
‘Nothing whatever,’ replied the emperor. ‘But if you
want peace with me, it is well, because you know me, and
that I can fight. Pay me part of the tribute collected at
Constantinople, and we shall be at peace.’ No better terms
were to be had, and the ambassadors left.</p>

<p>Michael probably understood that his refusal would be
followed by war. He therefore visited the fortifications
already gained in Thrace by the Greeks, strengthened them,
and within a few months the Latin empire was reduced to
the occupation of Constantinople and a small strip around
it. In the following year, 1260, Michael’s general, Strategopulus,
was entrusted with the command in Thrace. He
stormed Selymbria (the modern Silivria), and tried but
failed to capture Galata, which was already in the occupation
of the Genoese. Thereupon a truce was made for one
year.</p>

<p>Seeing that the Venetians, whose great power in the
Levant dates from the fall of Constantinople in 1204, in
which they had played so important a part, still maintained
their connection with the empire on the Bosporus and,
indeed, continued to be the principal source of such strength
as it possessed, Michael, to the great indignation of the pope
and the West, made an alliance with their rivals, the
Genoese, an alliance which was the foundation of their
supremacy in trade in the Black Sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of
Constantinople
by
the Greeks.</div>

<p>It is not impossible that Strategopulus had been sent
into Thrace in 1260 rather to form a judgment of the
chances of capturing the city than of making war. It is
quite possible, as suggested even by Pachymer, that the
attempt on Galata was a mere feint in order that he might
get into communication with friends in the capital. In
consenting to give a year’s truce, however, Michael seems to
have been sincere. Accordingly, when, in 1261, he again sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Strategopulus into Thrace it was with instructions that he
was not to attack the city. He had with him only 800
men, but as he passed through the country behind Constantinople
the Greek settlers (Volunteers, as they are called,
(Θεληματάριοι), who had friends in the city, flocked to him,
and urged that he would never have a better chance of
capturing it than at that time. The last detachment of
troops which had come from France had left the city, with
the Venetian fleet, upon an expedition into the Black Sea
to capture Daphnusia. Constantinople might be surprised
in their absence. In spite of the imperial orders, the chance
was too good to be missed. He brought his men to the
neighbourhood of the capital, and hid them near the Holy
Well of Baloukli, situated at about half a mile from the Gate
of the Fountain,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> one of the important entrances into the
city through the landward walls. His volunteers had not
deceived him when they stated that they had friends in the
city. Probably every Greek was a secret sympathiser.</p>

<p>George Acropolitas, who died in 1282, and whose
account, therefore, must have been written while the events
were fresh in his memory, gives the most trustworthy version
of what happened. He says: ‘But as Strategopulus had
some men near him who had come from the city and were
well acquainted with all that had passed there, from whom
he learned that there was a hole in the walls of the city
through which an armed man could easily pass, he lost no
time and set to work. A man passed through this hole;
another followed, then others, until fifteen, and perhaps
more, had got into the city. But, as they found a man on
the walls on guard, some of them mounted the wall and,
taking him by the feet, threw him over. Others having
axes in their hands broke the locks and bolts of the gates,
and thus rendered the entry easy for the army. This is how
the Cæsar Strategopulus, and all the men he had with him,
Romans and Scythians (for his army was composed of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>two peoples), made their entry into the city.’<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Probably
there were few inhabitants in that quarter, and the advance
to the principal part of the city might be made in the dark.
At dawn the invaders pushed on boldly, met with a brave
resistance from a few&mdash;a resistance which they soon overcame&mdash;and
the rest of the French<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> defenders were seized
with panic and fled. While the city was thus passing once
more into the hands of the Greeks, the French and Venetian
ships were coming straggling down the Bosporus, on their
return from Daphnusia, which they had failed to capture.
Accordingly, the army of Strategopulus and his volunteers
set fire to the dwellings in the French and Venetian
quarters in the city and to their villas on the European
shore of the Bosporus near Galata. While the foreigners
were occupied in saving their own property and their women
and children from the fire, Strategopulus strengthened his
position in the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flight of
Baldwin II.</div>

<p>The weak and incapable Baldwin was at the palace of
Blachern when the Greeks entered the city. Afraid to
pass through the streets where the fighting was going on,
he entered a boat, made his way down the Golden Horn,
and took refuge among other fugitives with the Venetian
fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of
Latin
empire.</div>

<p>His flight was on July 25, 1261, and with it ends the
history of the Latin empire in Constantinople. It had
been established by perjured Crusaders and filibustering
Venetians who were justly anathematised by Innocent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>Third. It had always been a sickly plant in a foreign and
uncongenial soil, and, though popes and kings had made
quite remarkable exertions to make it grow, it never even
gave a sign of taking root. The empire had succeeded, as
Innocent predicted that it would, in making the Greeks
loathe the members of the Latin Church like dogs, and in
rendering the union of the two Churches impossible. The
Crusaders, as Innocent had likewise foretold, had seized an
empire which they could not defend.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Their expedition had
broken up the great machine of Roman government which
had been working steadily and, in the main, well for nearly
a thousand years. It had done irreparable mischief unaccompanied
by any compensatory good. In the course of
two generations, the barons who had taken part in the capture
had died, and though among those who, at the bidding
of successive popes and of St. Louis, replaced them there
must have been many actuated by worthy motives, none
among them have left any evidence whatever of statesmanship
or of those qualities which have enabled nations to conciliate
or to assimilate the people whom they have conquered.
In sixty years the peasants might have become
content to acknowledge a change of rulers had they been
allowed to till their fields in peace: the traders might have
forgotten the hostility of their fathers if they had been
permitted to exercise their industry in security; but the
continued and ever increasing exactions of their masters
forbade them to forget that they were under alien rulers.
All that were worthy in the city had sought refuge elsewhere:
the priests, the students with their priceless
manuscripts, and the traders had escaped to Nicaea or to
Trebizond. The oppressors had seen themselves deserted
and the limits of the empire restricted almost to the boundaries
of the city. The Latin empire, which had never been
formidable, had become an object of contempt. When, however,
its last emperor slunk away as a fugitive from his
imperial city, he was hardly more contemptible than when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>he was present as a mendicant at the court of St. Louis or
of Henry the Third. His empire deserves only to be
remembered as a gigantic failure, a check to the progress of
European civilisation, a mischievous episode, an abortion
among states, born in sin, shapen in iniquity, and dying
amid ignominy.</p>

<p class="indent">CONDITION OF AND DIFFICULTIES IN RECONSTRUCTING
THE EMPIRE: DIFFICULTIES ARISING (A) FROM ATTEMPTS
BY LATINS TO RECOVER THE EMPIRE, (B) FROM CATALAN
GRAND COMPANY.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condition
of capital
on Baldwin’s
flight.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Constantinople was captured by the Crusaders and
Venetians it was adorned with the accumulated wealth of
centuries and decorated with art treasures for which not
only Greece but the whole Roman Empire had been ransacked.
When the city was recaptured by the Greeks it
was a desolation. Houses, churches, and monasteries were
in ruins; whole quarters were deserted. Heaps of rubbish
marked where extensive fires had consumed houses which
no one cared to rebuild. The imperial palace itself was in
so disorderly and filthy a condition that it was some time
before it could be occupied. In place of a large population
of the most educated and highly civilised people in Europe,
was a miserably small number of Greeks who had been
reduced to poverty with a number of foreign and principally
French colonists. While the foreign captors had plundered
the city and carried off the bronze horses of Lysippus and
innumerable other objects of art and value to Western
Europe, they and their successors during the fifty-eight
years of occupation had, in their contemptuous ignorance of
the art of a conquered people, destroyed probably more than
had been taken away as plunder.</p>

<p>The Queen City, which during many centuries had
preserved her inviolability and had largely for that reason
become the treasure-house of the empire and even of a
large part of the Western world, had lost her reputation as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
a place of safety. Amid the devastation in Egypt, in Syria,
and in Asia Minor, marked and mainly caused by the
advances of the Saracens and Seljukian Turks, by the
struggles of the Crusaders, and the destruction of the ancient
civilisations of Eastern Asia Minor occasioned by the westward
movements of Asiatic hordes, the merchant had known
only of one city where his merchandise was safe and where
he could trade in security.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of its
commerce.</div>

<p>The stream of commerce between the East and the West
which had flowed through the Bosporus had been diverted
into other channels, and the great <i>emboloi</i> and warehouses
were lying empty or in ruins. Tana or the Azof, which had
been the starting-point of a great caravan route through
Bokhara, Samarcand, and Balkh, now no longer contributed
largely to the commerce of Constantinople. Such of its
trade as was not sent overland to Western Europe was held
by the Venetians, and at a somewhat later period by the
Genoese or other Italians, and scarcely contributed at all to
the wealth of the capital. The Danube became during the
thirteenth century the highway between the Black and the
North Seas. The city which had been the great centre for
the collection and distribution of the furs, the hides, the
caviare and dried fish, the honey, wax, and other produce
which the Russian merchants collected and stored for the
use of the West, was now studiously avoided. The Western
traders who had met those from Novgorod, Tchernigov, and
Kief at Constantinople now found their way to the mouth
of the Dnieper and arranged for the transit of their goods so
as to avoid the pirates whom the Latin rulers of Constantinople
were unable to suppress, or the exactions levied upon
their merchandise if they came within the power of the
ancient capital. Trade which had come to Constantinople
along the ancient roads through Asia Minor had either ceased
to exist or had been diverted into other channels. The
confidence arising from a sense of security which through a
long series of years had attracted commerce could not be
restored and in fact was never regained. The loss of her
trade took from Constantinople the only external source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
revenue. The restored empire had thus to depend almost
exclusively upon the contributions which it could levy upon
the long harassed and impoverished peoples who recognised
its rule.</p>

<p>The recapture of the capital, though an epoch-marking
event, was only one step towards the restoration of the
empire. It never really was restored. It never recovered
the commanding position which it had occupied during even
the worst periods of its history since Constantine. Its
existence from 1261 to its capture by the Turks in 1453 is
one long struggle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties
of restored
empire.</div>

<p>The capital had been a centre which had kept well in
touch with even the remote corners of the empire. In it
had been the seat of government, the highest law courts
presided over by the ablest jurists, the continuators of the
work of Justinian, whose labour had formulated the law of
all continental Europe. There also was the centre of the
theological and religious life of the empire and the seat of
the administration. Unhappily, during the sixty years of
Latin rule the whole framework of this administration had
been broken up. A new plan of government had to be
devised. The new officials of the emperors were called upon
to govern without rules, without experience, and without
traditions. The forms of provincial and municipal government
were hardly remembered, and there were no men
trained in affairs to breathe life into them.</p>

<p>The influences at work in the capital had bound the
empire together, but they had been exercised through local
administrations. The result now was that the government
became centralised: that is, that matters which previously
would have been dealt with in the provinces by men with
local knowledge had to be dealt with in the capital by men
who were necessarily under many disadvantages. The effort
of its rulers after the city was recaptured was not merely to
restore to it the territory which had acknowledged its sway,
but to administer good government directly from its capital.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the desolation wrought in Constantinople
was reproduced throughout every portion of what had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the empire before the Latin conquest. The country had
been everywhere impoverished and the population diminished
by successive raids of Crusaders or pretenders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">From
foreign
states.</div>

<p>Nor were the external difficulties of the restored empire less
alarming. When Michael the Eighth entered the recaptured
city he found anarchy throughout his European territory
and neighbouring states eager to enlarge their boundaries at
his expense. The Bulgarians were a formidable power, whose
dominions were not divided from his own by any natural
boundary. The Serbians had utilised the period of the Latin
occupation to gather strength and were rising once again to
importance. The crusading families who had obtained fiefs
in Greece and the southern portion of Macedonia still
retained their independence. Genoese and Venetians, while
struggling against each other for the favour of the emperor,
were each on the alert to obtain territory as well as trading
privileges at his expense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">From
hostility
towards
Roman
Church.</div>

<p>One of the most serious evils inflicted on the empire by
the Latin occupation was the fierce antagonism it had created
in the Orthodox Church towards that of the elder Rome. We
have seen that Innocent had foreseen this result, but even he,
great statesman though he was, could hardly have anticipated
that the hatred aroused would be of so long a duration.
When the city had been captured a Latin patriarch had
been appointed, the union of the Churches had been forced
upon clergy and people, and the Church, which had always
considered itself the equal if not the superior of Rome, was
relegated to a position of inferiority. All attempts at reunion
were henceforward regarded not merely from the point
of view of religion, but from that of patriotism. Union was
part of the heritage of bondage. Union meant voluntary
submission to the foreign Church which had been able to
impose its rule during two generations. Union, therefore,
in the minds of a majority of both clergy and laity had to be
resisted as a badge of slavery.</p>

<p>Though the Latin empire had perished, there still
remained a Latin emperor or pretender, and he and his descendants,
with the support of successive popes and aided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
adventurers from France, Italy, and Spain, made many and
constant attempts to regain the position which had been
lost. For upwards of a century after the city’s recapture
there was a general scramble by the European neighbours
of the empire and Western powers for adjacent territory.
The dominions of the emperor were large and sparsely
populated, and offered an irresistible temptation to neighbouring
states. More formidable, however, than all other
enemies were the Turks. Though they had been attacked
in the rear and were for a while rent by internal dissensions,
they were steadily increasing: adding constantly by conquests
to the territory over which their emirs ruled, and
increasing in numbers by the never-failing stream of
immigrants and born warriors coming into Asia Minor from
Central Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">From
Michael’s
usurpation.</div>

<p>Among the first difficulties encountered in the reconstruction
of the empire must be noted that arising from the
irregularity of Michael’s own position. It is worthy of note,
not merely as a difficulty, but as showing the independent
spirit of the Orthodox Church. The reader will have ample
evidence of the inflexibility of its resistance on questions of
dogma, but the very commencement of the reign of Michael
illustrates how it was prepared to make a vigorous stand
even against the deliverer of the empire on the simple
ground of righteousness. We have seen that Michael had
no legal claim to the throne. The <i>de jure</i> heir was John,
a child of eight years when his father, Theodore Lascaris,
died. His guardians were Michael, who had been made
Grand Duke, and Arsenius the Patriarch. When a year
afterwards, in 1261, the city was recaptured, it was expected
by some persons of influence that Michael would either
simply act as regent or associate John with him as co-emperor
as soon as he became of age. Michael, however,
in the same year, blinded the boy, so as to render him
incapable of ascending the throne.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Arsenius the Patriarch,
as soon as the cruel deed became known, called a
meeting of the bishops and boldly pronounced against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>emperor a formal sentence of excommunication. None of the
bishops opposed. They did not attempt to depose him. One
can only conjecture why they hesitated. Possibly it was
because they considered it expedient that he should remain
on the throne, or it may be that they regarded such a step as
beyond their jurisdiction. The emperor was alarmed, feared
the consequences of excommunication among the troops, but
feared probably still more the spiritual penalties which
would follow the sentence. He preferred, says Pachymer,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
to die rather than to live burdened with the anathemas of
the Church. He sought out friends of the patriarch and
begged them to use all their influence to have the penalties
removed. He urged that penance should be imposed, and
professed himself ready to undergo any which might be
deemed necessary to atone for his fault. The patriarch
replied that, even if he were threatened with death, he would
never remove the excommunication. The emperor went
himself to visit Arsenius, and in the conversation asked
whether it was his wish that he should abdicate, unbuckling
his sword as he did so. When, however, the patriarch
stretched out his hand to receive it, the emperor put it back.
The patriarch remained firm. The emperor complained bitterly
to his friends of the conduct of Arsenius, and threatened
that, as his own Church would not grant him absolution, he
would have recourse to the pope, who would be more conciliatory.
Years passed and Arsenius constantly refused to give
way. Every means thought of by the emperor of conciliating
him had failed, and he at length determined to have him
deposed. But threats and promises were equally unavailable.
He had called together the bishops on several occasions and
complained that it was impossible for him to govern the
country unless he was relieved of so heavy a burden.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> On
the last of these occasions he claimed that by the law of the
Church every Christian had a right to absolution on doing
penance, and he asked whether such laws were to be construed
less favourably for princes than for other sinners.
He submitted that the patriarch had treated him not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>unjustly but illegally, and concluded by inviting the bishops
to depose Arsenius.</p>

<p>Once more he sent to ask the patriarch whether or not
he would grant absolution, and once more Arsenius refused.
Upon this, as the bishops would not consent to declare that
he was not justified in maintaining the anathema, the
emperor had Articles of Accusation drawn against him.
The charges were not altogether of a trivial character. He
accused him of having shortened the prayer for the emperor
in matins; of having ordered the omission of the Trisagion;
of having conversed in a friendly manner with the sultan of
the Seljukian Turks; of having allowed him and other
Mahometan companions to bathe in a bath belonging to
the Church, where there were crosses; of having ordered a
monk to administer the Sacrament to the sultan’s children,
although he was not certain that they had been baptised.</p>

<p>An assembly of bishops was convoked to examine the
charges. The patriarch replied by objecting to the meeting
of the court in the palace, refused to appear, and promised
to send his answer to the charges in writing. Pachymer
recounts in some detail how the emperor endeavoured to
obtain absolution by a trick, and how Arsenius on discovering
it asked him if he thought he could deceive God. The
emperor in reply insisted that some of the charges should
be pressed on to hearing and obtained a majority of votes
condemning the patriarch.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The patriarch was thereupon exiled.</p>

<p>His successor, Germanus, removed the anathema, but
doubts arose in the emperor’s mind whether the removal
was valid. After a few months Germanus was persuaded
by the emperor to retire, and in his place the nominee of
Michael, a certain Joseph, was named. The new patriarch
was a courtier, and probably knew that the principal reason
for his election was that absolution might be effectively and
publicly given. The emperor allowed Joseph a month
within which to consider the best means of granting him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>absolution, and then all was arranged. On the great feast
of Candlemas, February 2, 1267, there was a notable
function in Hagia Sophia for the removal of the anathema.
The ceremony was a long and solemn one, the patriarch
and the bishops, and probably the emperor and his suite,
having had to pass the whole night in the church. The
great church was crowded with worshippers or spectators.
When the liturgy was completed the emperor, who had thus
far remained standing surrounded by his guards and senators,
drew near the Holy Gates<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> behind which stood the bishops.
Then, uncovered, he prostrated himself to the ground at the
feet of the patriarch, publicly confessed his sin, and humbly
demanded pardon. While he was thus prostrate, the patriarch,
and after him each of the bishops, read the formula by
which he was absolved from the crime committed against
the young emperor. When all had thus given absolution,
the emperor rose, was admitted to Holy Communion, and,
says Pachymer, henceforward treated John with every kindness.
The point, however, to be noted is that even the
emperor, strong-willed usurper as he was, was not merely
afraid of the terrors of the Church, but found it extremely
difficult to bend it to his will so as to obtain the removal of
its sentence for an unjust act, although there were many
obvious advantages to the state in complying with the
emperor’s wish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties
arising
from
attempts
by Latins
to recover
the
Empire.</div>

<p class="tb">From the first year of his accession Michael the Eighth
set himself the task of diverting from the empire the attacks
of Western states. It was not to be expected that Baldwin
and the statesmen of the West would settle down resignedly
to the loss of a Latin empire. During many years their
attempts to regain the city constituted the most pressing
danger to the empire and contributed more than any other
cause during Michael’s reign to render it unable to hold its
own against the encroachments of the Turks. To Michael,
as to all other statesmen in Europe, the representative of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>West was the pope. To satisfy the pope was to appease
Western Europe, to divert attacks from the empire, and to
cause aid to be sent against the Moslems. But the pope, on
the accession of Michael, was doubly offended: first, because
the Latin empire had been overthrown, and second, because
the prospect of union between the two Churches was put
back. Several years had to pass and many struggles had to be
borne before the pontiffs reconciled themselves to the final
disappearance of that Latin empire the foundation of which
the great statesman Pope Innocent the Third had dreaded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts
at reconciliation
with
Roman
Church.</div>

<p>Michael, while resisting all attacks made or favoured
by the pope, saw the desirability of being reconciled with
him so as, if possible, to induce him not to lend his support
to the efforts of Baldwin to recover the city. With this
object he never lost an opportunity, even at the cost of
alienating the sympathies of his own people and being
denounced by his own ecclesiastics, of endeavouring to gain
the pontifical favour by attempting to bring about the Union
of the Churches.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that from his accession until the end of
his reign these attempts fill a part of all contemporary histories
quite disproportionate to what at first sight appears
their importance. It is even more remarkable that during
the whole period between the capture of the city by Michael
and the Moslem siege in 1453 the dominant question of
interest was that of the Union of the Churches. The fact
that the representative of Western Europe was the sovereign
pontiff accounts to a great extent, though not altogether,
for the prominent part played by the religious question in
nearly all the negotiations between the later emperors and
the West. Not even the constant and almost unceasing
struggle with the Turks occupies so much attention as do the
negotiations with Rome, the embassies, the Councils, and the
ever-varying tentatives to bring the two Churches into
reconciliation. No true conception of the life of the empire
can be formed unless it is realised how completely its citizens
were occupied with these semi-religious, semi-political questions.
On one side the popes were almost constant in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
attempts, now to compel the Eastern Church to come in,
now to persuade it; on the other, the emperors, while fully
cognisant of the importance of diverting Western attacks
and, at a later period, of receiving aid against the common
enemy of Christendom, had constantly to meet with the
dogged and unceasing opposition and bitter hostility of the
great mass of their subjects to purchasing help at the price
of union with the Latin Church.</p>

<p>A struggle began immediately on the accession of
Michael and soon became a curiously complicated strife.
The pope in 1262 proclaimed a Crusade against him and
against the Genoese, who still remained allied with him.
The pontiff characterised Michael as a usurper and a schismatic,
and granted the same indulgences to those who took
up arms or contributed to the expenses of the expedition
against him as to those who fought for the deliverance of
the Holy Land. He urged St. Louis to collect tithes for
the same purpose.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Michael, on the other hand, while preparing
to resist invasion and strengthening the city walls,
increasing his fleet, and raising new levies, yet sought to
satisfy the pope by offering to do his utmost to bring about
the Union of the Churches. Possibly owing to the emperor’s
representations, Urban the Fourth countermanded the proposed
expedition, diverting it against the Tartars who were
then invading Palestine. He sent friars to Constantinople
to exhort the emperor to carry out his proposal for reunion.
His successor, Clement, was, however, a man of a different
spirit and replied to the promises of Michael that they were
only fair words intended to prevent him from aiding the
dethroned Baldwin. While Michael had undoubtedly this
object in view, he seems to have been sincere in his desire
for Union. One of his objections to the patriarch Arsenius
was that he would have nothing to do with the Latins.
The Greek priests clamoured to such an extent against the
patriarch who succeeded Arsenius, because he was believed
to be willing to follow the emperor’s example in working
for Union, that he was compelled to resign.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>
<p>As time went on, the Venetians, whose influence in the
city had fallen with the Latin empire, began to lose hope of
seeing Baldwin re-established on the throne, and in 1267 sent
to make peace with Michael. Gregory the Tenth threatened
the doge with anathema if he even made a truce with him.
The emperor endeavoured, though in vain, to appease the
wrath of the pope by obtaining the intervention of Louis of
France. Gregory, whom Michael had congratulated on his
accession upon the death of Clement, was more conciliatory.
He sent legates to the capital to treat once more on Union.
Pachymer gives a vivid account of the negotiations which
followed, an account from which it is difficult to doubt the
sincerity of the emperor’s wish for reconciliation or the
persistence of the opposition which he had to encounter.
He states<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> that the emperor followed the example of John
Ducas of Nicaea, that he sent many embassies to Rome,
and that his real object was to obtain from the popes protection
for the Greeks. Gregory assured him that no time
was so favourable as the present for putting an end to the
Greek schism. The emperor on his side did his utmost to
persuade the patriarch and the bishops to aid him. The
Latin delegates themselves were men of piety who showed
every possible respect for the Greek rite. They were
invited to discuss the differences between the dogmas of the
two Churches. In their interviews with the bishops they
claimed that the <i>Filioque</i> clause which constituted the great
point of discussion was a divine mystery which was impenetrable,
that while the difference between the Latin formula
which declared that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the
Father and the Son was not really at variance with the
Greek that He proceeded from the Father by the Son, they
ought to be content with the reasons which the Latins
adduced for inserting it in the Creed. The bishops met
these observations with a rugged <i>non possumus</i>. Their
Creed was what had been consecrated by the usage of centuries.
It was dangerous for any one Church to add to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>Symbols even words which were not contrary to the Catholic
faith. The bishops openly declared that, whatever the
threats of the emperor might be, they would hold to the
ancient formula.</p>

<p>News of an expedition to restore the Latin empire came
pouring in, and the emperor determined to have his own
way and to conciliate the pope. In an assembly in which
the patriarch, bishops, and other ecclesiastics took part he
spoke at great length in favour of reconciliation. The
patriarch appointed Veccus, a man famous for his eloquence
and learning, to reply to him. His reply is summed
up by Pachymer: ‘There are heretics who are so called.
There are some who are not heretics and are not so called.
There are some who are called but are not heretics,
and lastly there are others who are not called but are
heretics, and it is in this latter class that the Latins must
be placed.’</p>

<p>The emperor dismissed the assembly and was violently
angry against Veccus, whom he accused of having acted
with bad faith. Having failed in substantiating a formal
charge, he arbitrarily sent him prisoner to the Tower of
Anemas. While in prison, however, Michael furnished him
with books which favoured the Latin case, and, says Pachymer,
as he was a man of singular simplicity and of sincere love
for the truth he became disposed towards reconciliation.
He was released. The emperor pressed the patriarch and
the bishops to find a <i>modus vivendi</i> with the Latins, and
was now aided by Veccus, who had discovered that the sole
fault of the Western Church was that it had solely upon
its own authority added the obnoxious clause to the Creed.
The patriarch and the bishops, however, were obdurate. By
dint of persecution, by requiring them to pay arrears of rent
for their monasteries and houses, he sought to force them
to come to an arrangement. He called another assembly
and finally succeeded in obtaining a declaration from them
with which for the time he was forced to be content. In
this very assembly, however, one of the aged bishops
besought him not to press the Union, assuring him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
even if the dignitaries signed no one else would accept it.
The Arsenites and the Josephites, as the followers of the
two ex-patriarchs who would not comply with the emperor’s
wish were called, had with them the great mass of the citizens,
and the aged dignitary was probably right when he
stated<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> that if the emperor persisted, civil war would be
the consequence.</p>

<p>Meantime the emperor, who could not or would not
understand this bitter opposition to his desires, was aware
that negotiations were going on between Charles of Anjou,
king of Sicily (whose daughter had married the son and
heir of Baldwin, the ex-emperor), and the Venetians for an
attack upon his territories and the restoration of the Latin
empire. Michael sent costly presents to the pope, and
once more declared his determination to bring about Union,
and asked his indulgence. Once more he sent delegates to
the pope, who in return ordered Charles to facilitate their
passage through his dominions and to postpone hostilities.
The emperor insisted on Union, and in the following year,
1274, he and some of the bishops sent other delegates to
Lyons to complete a formal reconciliation. On their arrival
in that city they pronounced during the celebration of Mass
the obnoxious clause. Gregory the Tenth declared that
they had come voluntarily to submit themselves, to make
the Roman confession of faith, and to recognise his supremacy.
After George Acropolitas had read the emperor’s
profession, and the envoy of the bishops theirs, a <i>Te Deum</i>
was sung and the Union proclaimed. But whatever the
pope or the emperor might wish or even do, the Eastern
Church was not prepared to ratify a reconciliation. The
patriarch still refused to yield. He had gone as far as he
intended to go and declared that he would abdicate if the
Union were accomplished. Thereupon he was deposed by
the synod. Immediately afterwards the pope’s name was
introduced into the public prayers, but with the result that
the breach between those in favour of Union and those
opposed to it became wider. The emperor pertinaciously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>persevered, and with his consent Veccus, who had now gone
over to the emperor’s side, was named patriarch.</p>

<p>On the return of the delegates from Lyons, preaching
friars were sent to Constantinople by Innocent the Fifth.
On his death, in 1276, his successor, John the Twenty-fifth,
sent nuncios, who were received with great honour, and
Michael, in return, together with the patriarch sent delegates
to confirm the Union. They arrived, however, in Rome after
the death of John. In 1277 Michael and his son Andronicus,
the heir to the throne, who was now of full age, formally confirmed
the Union of the Churches. Thereupon there began a
struggle with those who opposed it. The patriarch Veccus
excommunicated its adversaries, mentioning the leaders by
name. John the Bastard, the despot of Epirus, who was
the foremost, at once called a Council and submitted the
question to its decision. This Council anathematised alike
the emperor, the pope, and the patriarch. Some of the
nobles and officers sent against John openly declared for
him as the defender of the ancient faith.</p>

<p>The new pope was convinced that the emperor was doing
his utmost to bring about Union, and in consequence refused
permission to Charles of Anjou to send an expedition
against him. When his nuncios arrived, in 1279, in the
capital, they learned that, in spite of the emperor and the
patriarch, the clergy and people would not accept Union.
The nuncios were taken to the prisons and saw nobles, even
of the emperor’s own family, as well as many others, loaded
with chains on account of their opposition on this question
to the imperial wish. They were convinced of the emperor’s
good faith, but no definite statement could be obtained from
the bishops. <i>Non possumus</i> remained the expression of their
attitude.</p>

<p>When, however, Martin the Fourth learned from the
nuncios what was the position in Constantinople, he seems
either to have lost all hope of bringing about Union by
persuasion, or possibly to have thought that his predecessor
had been deceived by Michael; for in 1281 he excommunicated
the emperor and all the Greeks as schismatics. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
so doing he became free to assist in organising the long-threatened
expedition for the restoration of the Latin
empire. Michael in reply simply contented himself with
the omission of the pope’s name from the prayers.</p>

<p>Martin followed up his excommunication by joining in
a league with Charles of Anjou and the Venetians in order
to replace Michael by Philip, the son of Baldwin the Latin
emperor. In the following year the pope in renewing his
excommunication gave the emperor until May 1, 1282,
within which to submit himself under pain of being deposed.</p>

<p>Michael’s position was desperate. He had alienated his
own subjects; he had risked his throne, imprisoned his
nearest relations, had tried bribes, intrigues, flattery, and
force. Worse than all, he had been forced to allow the
various hordes of Moslems in Asia Minor&mdash;Turks, Kurds,
and Tartars&mdash;to encroach on the territory of the empire at
a time when, if he had had a free hand, a serious check might
have been put to their progress. All was in vain. His
failure with the popes was now as complete as with his own
people. The threat of an expedition under Charles of Anjou
was so serious that he sent thirty thousand ounces of gold
to Peter of Aragon to assist him in defeating Charles and
diverting his expedition from the Bosporus. He became
irritable and melancholy at the obstinacy of his subjects
and punished them with unreasonable severity and great
cruelty.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Death of

<div class="sidenote">Reign of
Andronicus
II.,
1282–1328.</div>

<p>During the long reign of Andronicus the Second (1282
to 1328), the son and successor of Michael, the party which
the latter had headed in favour of Union with Rome fell
to pieces. The older emperor’s disappointment probably
hastened his death. Veccus the patriarch within a few
months was forced to withdraw to a monastery. His
writings in favour of Union were burned. He was put upon
his trial before a synod and saved himself by signing a
declaration against further attempts at reconciliation with
the Latin Church. The ex-patriarch Joseph was brought
back in triumph, and a persecution at once commenced of
those who had favoured the emperor’s plans.</p>

<p>This hostility to the Unionist party was contemporaneous
with a short period during which the fear of an attack to reestablish
a Latin empire had lessened. The attention of the
pontiff was directed towards sending aid to the king of
Armenia, who had been for years making a brave defence
against his Moslem assailants. But the attempt at Union
and the re-establishment of a Latin empire was not
forgotten. In 1287 Nicholas the Fourth endeavoured to
accomplish these objects while allowing the Greek emperor
to remain on the throne. He favoured, and perhaps suggested,
a marriage between Michael, the eldest son of Andronicus,
and Catherine of Courtenay, the granddaughter of
Baldwin. Her other grandfather, Charles of Anjou, king
of Sicily, claimed the imperial throne on her behalf.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The
proposal of marriage had much to recommend it to the
emperor, because it appeared to be a means of putting an
end to the attempts to regain the imperial throne by the
deposed family. The arrangements were broken off because
Andronicus would not agree to recognise the pope’s supremacy,
without which the pontiff refused his consent. Considering
the attitude of the Greek ecclesiastics, there can be
little doubt that if the emperor had agreed to the pope’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>demand the already strained relations between the Orthodox
and the Roman parties would have become dangerous to the
state, would have probably brought about civil war, and
might have cost Andronicus his throne. The question after
long negotiations was settled in 1295 by the marriage of
Michael with the sister of the king of Armenia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Popes
favour project
for reestablishing

empire.</div>

<p>The popes thereupon took a bolder course. They had
seen the futility of the efforts to obtain Union by negotiation
with the emperor, and now supported a series of attempts to
recapture Constantinople and to place upon the throne a
descendant of the last Latin emperor, Baldwin the Second.
If the recapture could be accomplished, the Union so dear
to Rome could be brought about by force.</p>

<p>In 1301 Catherine of Courtenay married Charles of
Valois, brother of the king of France.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The marriage was
a political one, its object being to give the hand of Catherine
to a Western prince of sufficient standing to arouse an
enthusiasm in all the West in favour of the restoration of
the Latin empire. Charles at once entered into a treaty
with the Venetians for the conquest of Constantinople, and
arranged to recognise the assignment of certain portions of
the empire which had already been made to other descendants
of Baldwin. A Venetian was designated by the pope
as Latin patriarch of Constantinople. Eighteen Venetian
ships went to the capital, and were sufficiently powerful to
force the emperor to grant trading concessions. Charles of
Anjou and Frederic of Aragon bound themselves to aid in
the attempts to recapture Constantinople.</p>

<p>It was in presence of this threatened attack, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>appeared to be far the most serious which had been contemplated
since the city’s recapture, that the emperor
invited a certain Roger de Flor and his band of Spanish
mercenaries, who came to be known as the Catalan Grand
Company, to come to his aid.</p>

<p>Within the city itself great efforts were made, in presence
of the common danger, to unite the theological factions.
The patriarch, who had pronounced an anathema against
the emperor, consented to withdraw it. The truce, however,
between the ecclesiastics was unfortunately of short
duration. As time passed, and the much-vaunted expedition
did not present itself, the old rancours again showed themselves.</p>

<p>Indeed, the expedition to place Charles of Valois on the
imperial throne made slow progress. In 1305 his brother,
the king of France, gave it his support. Once more the
pontiff invited the Venetians to follow the example of
Dandolo and aid in the conquest of the city. It was not,
however, till the end of 1306 that a treaty of alliance was
made between them and Charles. The result which might
have been anticipated followed when the news was received
in the capital. The Latin monks, who up to this time had
been tolerated within the city, were expelled, and the party
in favour of Union almost entirely disappeared. Meantime
the preparations for the expedition continued.</p>

<p>In 1308 its titular head, Charles of Valois, allied himself
with the Servians. Charles himself was ready, but apparently
not eager, for the enterprise. The Venetians
desired speedy action; but the Western nobles only feebly
responded to the pope’s demand, although it was supported
by the king of France. Charles of Anjou was not ready.
In the course of the next year Catherine of Courtenay died,
and partly on account of her death, and probably also
because he despaired of leading a successful enterprise,
Charles of Valois abandoned the design of capturing Constantinople.
He, however, transferred what he considered his
rights to the throne to his son-in-law, Philip of Tarentum.</p>

<p>The Venetians resigned themselves to a position which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
would allow them once more to trade with the empire, and
in 1310 concluded a truce with its ruler for ten years.</p>

<p>Philip now prepared to organise an attempt against
Constantinople, and once more the pope, in 1313, weakened
the position of the Latin party in Constantinople by calling
upon Frederic, king of Sicily, to aid the new pretender.
The king of France undertook to furnish five hundred men-at-arms,
and money to pay them for a year, and called upon
Louis of Burgundy to furnish another hundred. The undertaking,
however, languished, and when Philip of France
died, in 1314, no one, except Philip of Tarentum, seemed to
have any further interest in it. He leagued himself with
the king of Hungary in 1318, and two years later purchased
certain rights in the principality of Achaia and what was still
spoken of in the West as the kingdom of Thessalonica.
But no favourable opportunity came to him, and in 1324 the
doge of Venice notified the emperor that the princes of the
West had no intention of attacking the imperial city. The
notification turned out correct, for, until his dethronement,
in 1328, Andronicus was no longer troubled with tidings of
expeditions against Constantinople from Western Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

Expedition
Against
Constantinople.</div>

<p class="tb">Meantime it is necessary to return to the invitation
which Andronicus had given to Robert de Flor to come to
his aid. This aid was intended nominally against the Turks,
but really against the expedition which Charles of Valois
was preparing, with the sanction of the pope and the help
of the Venetians and of all men who would respond to the
pope’s exhortation, to assist in restoring a Latin emperor
to Constantinople. The invitation brought into the empire
a band of auxiliaries from the West which, in its weakened
condition, was almost as mischievous and ruinous to the
empire as any expedition openly directed against its existence
could have been. The evil inflicted upon the empire
by the band of mercenaries invited for its defence was
indeed so manifold that the story deserves telling with
considerable detail.</p>

<p>As already stated, Philip, the son of Baldwin, the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Latin emperor, had married the daughter of Charles of
Anjou, king of Sicily. Charles promised, in 1278, to send
an expedition to Constantinople, but the pope, seeing the
efforts which Michael continued to make for Union, refused
his sanction. Two years later, however, a new pope
entered into a treaty with Venice and Naples to attack the
empire, and Charles undertook to send eight hundred
cavaliers to claim what he considered the rights of his granddaughter.
A body of troops was sent across the Adriatic to
assist the Albanians, who were fighting against the emperor.
The invaders were utterly defeated, and the empire was
saved from the attack of Charles by the disorganisation
produced by the Sicilian Vespers in 1283, a massacre in
which 8,000 Frenchmen perished.</p>

<p>In the twenty years that followed, a body of Spanish
mercenaries played a prominent part in the Sicilian troubles.
Spain had been engaged for three hundred years in a long
and almost continuous struggle against the Moors. Fathers
had dedicated their sons in successive generations to the
defence of Christianity and their country, and the result
was already to have formed a nation of brave and disciplined
soldiers, such as Western Europe had not seen since the
best days of the Roman empire. Peter of Aragon had
supplied a band of such soldiers to fight against France in
Sicily and Calabria.</p>

<p>In 1301 the marriage of Catherine of Courtenay, daughter
of Philip, and granddaughter of Baldwin the Second, with
Charles of Valois, son of Philip the Second of France, and
brother of the king, put an end to the troubles in Sicily with
the French.</p>

<p>Now that, in 1302, peace was concluded in Sicily, their
employers were anxious to be rid of the now useless mercenaries;
for, though their courage, their recklessness of danger,
and their prowess were indisputable, their lawlessness, their
cruelty to the inhabitants of the country where they were
encamped, and their insubordination, even to their own
officers, were no less remarkable. Moreover, Frederic of
Sicily was unable to pay them, and they had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
commenced to pay themselves by general plunder. Unaccustomed
to work, and used only to a life of rapine, they were
ready to take service under any leader who appeared able to
offer them good chances of pillage; but woe to the country
to which they were sent, and to the cause which they
promised to serve!</p>

<p>Among their leaders was a German named Robert Blum,
whose name became changed or translated to Roger de Flor.
He was a typical instance of the worst kind of soldier of
fortune of the middle ages. He entered the order of the
Templars, but was degraded because he betrayed the
Christians in return for bribes from the Moslems. Then he
turned pirate, and sought foreign service. The French
refused to have anything to do with him. He had therefore
gone over to the enemy, and the king of Sicily made
him vice-admiral. He robbed for his master wherever he
could find anything to steal. If he met an enemy, he took
all he could carry away, without acknowledgment; if a
friend, he took what he wanted, and gave acknowledgments
of a very doubtful value, which were to be paid by the king
of Sicily at the end of the war.</p>

<p>When the Sicilian war was over, the Grand Master of
the Temple urged the pope to insist that Roger de Flor
should be surrendered for punishment. Roger learned that
such a demand was about to be made<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and anticipated
extradition by taking service with the Greek emperor,
nominally to fight against the Turks, promising to bring
with him a body of Spanish troops. The alarm of
Andronicus at the report of the expedition of Charles of
Valois against him was great. It looked as if all Western
princes were about to enter upon a new crusade for the
recapture of Constantinople. Hence he was prepared to
welcome aid from any source.</p>

<p>In 1303 Roger de Flor arrived at Constantinople with a
fleet of seven ships and eight thousand men, who are
described by Pachymer as Catalans and Amogavares, the
latter being adventurers from other parts of Spain than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>Catalonia. This band was soon spoken of as the Catalan
Grand Company.</p>

<p>Roger was accompanied by Fernand Ximenes, who was
also at the head of a large body of retainers who were
desirous of taking service under the emperor. The reputation
which Roger de Flor bore as the most daring of soldiers
caused him to be eagerly welcomed by the emperor, who
conferred upon him the title of Grand Duke and hoped
much from his services. His reckless followers knew only
one virtue&mdash;that of courage. Their first adventure showed,
however, the spirit of lawlessness which existed in his army.
The emperor had borrowed a large sum of money from the
Genoese which Roger alleged that he had employed in
raising new troops. When the Genoese applied to Roger
for payment it was refused. The emperor sent a high
official to arrange the difficulty, and the Catalans cut him in
pieces. The Grand Company were at this time encamped
outside the city walls in the neighbourhood of the present
Eyoub. They seized the monastery of St. Cosmas and held
it as a fortress. The Genoese erected barricades on the
shore of the Golden Horn, and a struggle took place between
the two in which many were killed on both sides.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the Spaniards were induced to cross
the Marmora to Cyzicus, and a quarrel ensued between them
and the Alans, one of the first of many Asiatic tribes who
had pushed their way into the valley of the Danube, and a
band of whom had been taken into the imperial service.
The son of the leader of the Alans was killed, and his soldiers
vowed vengeance. Roger de Flor then pushed on to attack
the Turks. He was seen at his best when he met the
enemy. He raised the siege of Philadelphia and defeated
the various armies sent against him, killing, it is said, thirty
thousand Turks and driving the rest of them out of Lydia
and Caria. But he was almost as terrible to the Christians
whom he had been sent to protect as he was to the Moslems.
His progress through Asia Minor was marked by constant
plunder. Pachymer says that those subjects of the emperor
who fell into his hands after they had escaped from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
enemy had thrown themselves out of the smoke into the
fire. Those who gave up their property had difficulty in
saving their lives. The remark is made on the occasion of
Roger’s visit to Philadelphia, which he pillaged as if it had
been an enemy’s city. He treated Pergamos and Ephesus
in the same way. His ships plundered the islands of Chios,
Lemnos, and Mytilene. The inhabitants of Magnesia
resisted his exactions, and he therefore laid siege to the city
and did his utmost to capture it. It was in vain that the
emperor sent orders to raise the siege and to attack Turks
and not Christians. The Alans who were with him urged
obedience and withdrew when Roger refused. It was only
after a long siege that he recognised that he was unable to
capture the city and abandoned the attempt. In retreating
he plundered the Greeks as remorselessly as he did the
Turks against whom he had been sent. ‘Notwithstanding,’
says Pachymer, ‘that the emperor had prepared all that
was needed for the support of Roger and his army, the
peasants were robbed of everything they possessed and were
left without either seed-corn or oxen for ploughing. At
the news of his coming many abandoned their farms and
took refuge in the islands. He appropriated to his own use
the tithes and other taxes which should have gone to the
emperor.’ Indeed there appears no reason to doubt the
assertion that this adventurer had now formed the intention
of carving out a kingdom for himself. It is possible indeed,
and is in conformity with his conduct, that from the first he
had entertained such an intention. From this time until
his death he became the enemy of the emperor whom he
had come to aid.</p>

<p>When the Greek troops heard of the outrages on their
countrymen they asked the emperor to be led against the
Catalans instead of against the Turks. But the emperor
himself was unwilling to break with Roger and his army, or
even that they should be distant from the city so long as he
expected the arrival of the great expedition intended for its
capture. He still also cherished the hope that the services
of the Grand Company might be employed against the Turks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
in case the expedition from the West did not arrive. While
he was hesitating, Berenger of Catalonia arrived with new
reinforcements in nine large vessels, and soon he and Roger
presented themselves at the imperial court. Roger urged
the emperor to subsidise Berenger, and in reply to the
question why the latter had come answered, because he had
heard of the liberality of the emperor’s payments. In a
formal assembly he reproached Roger with the lawlessness
of his troops, with the injury he had done to the Greeks,
and especially with the burden of expenses he had cast upon
the empire. Finally, however, he consented to receive
Berenger and to assign to him a portion of the tithes for the
maintenance of the Catalan armies.</p>

<p>When, shortly after, a deputation of Catalans was sent
to the emperor demanding further pay, he replied by
emptying in their presence sacks full of letters complaining
of exactions by the Spaniards. In spite of these complaints
and of the exactions and lawlessness of the Grand Company,
he appears to have been unwilling to lose their services. He
recounted the money payments he had made, but promised
to give them more than they had asked if only they would
at once return to attack the enemy in Asia. The deputation
knew the emperor’s anxiety and desire to keep his own
troops for the defence of the city against the expedition of
Charles, and therefore refused to return without further
payment. All argument was useless. Berenger was dissatisfied
with the offers made to him personally and sailed
away from the Golden Horn during the night for Gallipoli,
which city was held by his countrymen. Roger pleaded in
vain for more money to be paid at once. It was not there
to be given. The tension between the Spaniards and the
emperor became so great that the latter sent orders to his
son Michael, encamped near Apros, to be ready against an
attack by the Catalans.</p>

<p>Some months later, in 1307, Roger went to Adrianople
under pretence that he wished to pay his respects to Michael
at Apros and to take leave of him, as he declared he was
about to quit the country. Pachymer, probably reflecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the popular belief, states that his real object was to learn
the number of men in the Greek army and what were his
chances in an attack upon it. Michael received him in a
friendly manner, but the Alans in his service had not forgotten
the vengeance they had vowed against him for having
at Cyzicus killed the son of George their leader, and as Roger
was entering the audience chamber he was stabbed by George
<span class="sidenote">Assassination
of
Roger de
Flor.</span>himself. Upon news of the assassination, the Catalans fled
to Gallipoli, putting men, women, and children to the sword
during their flight. Michael followed them and laid siege
to the city, but Berenger persuaded the Emperor Andronicus
to grant the besieged time and so arranged matters that the
Spaniards were able to take ship and escape. They made
their way once more across the Marmora to Cyzicus, but the
inhabitants stoutly resisted, and the besiegers left for Perinthos,
where they killed every man they could lay hands
on. When the news reached the capital the inhabitants
demanded vengeance on those of the Catalans who had
remained there and, taking the law into their own hands,
burned their houses. The patriarch, who had in vain
attempted to check their fury, with difficulty saved his own
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Outrages
by the
Grand
Company.</div>

<p>The Spaniards were now at open war with the Greeks,
and even Andronicus would have been glad to get rid of
them. They attacked the seafaring population at Rhegium,
now called Buyuk Chekmeji, burnt several men, impaled
their children, and massacred those whom they had employed
to carry off their booty. Their progress was checked for
a while by the arrival of sixteen Genoese ships. As the
Genoese had had trouble with the emperor, the Spaniards
were in hopes of their aid, but the former sent secretly into
the city from their fleet to learn the truth about the
situation, heard the Greek version of the differences, and
then declared for the emperor. The Genoese and imperial
fleets attacked the Spaniards, who were led by Berenger,
defeated them, captured their leader, and subsequently sent
him prisoner to Italy.</p>

<p>Gallipoli was, however, still in the hands of the Catalans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Turkish
auxiliaries

Europe.</span>and an attempt to buy the aid of the Genoese to relieve it
failed. Michael endeavoured to capture it. Both armies
had secured Turkish allies. A decisive battle was fought
near Apros, in which the Spaniards were successful. They
followed up their victory by ravaging the neighbouring
country, and in this they were joined by a band of Turks who
had been invited to join them and by Alans who had quitted
the imperial service.</p>

<p>The country between Constantinople and Adrianople was
laid waste, all the inhabitants abandoning their houses to
save their lives. The garrison of Catalans in Gallipoli in
like manner ravaged the western part of Thrace; men were
killed, women and children, flocks and herds were carried
off. The women and children were taken to be sold to, or to
be held as slaves by, the Turks.</p>

<p>The emperor, unable either to employ or to defeat the
Spaniards and being hard pressed by the Turks in Asia
Minor, endeavoured now to buy them off. An embassy was
sent to them, but the conditions demanded were impossible,
and thereupon the scenes of violence were renewed. Bands
of Spaniards and their Turkish allies made incursions in the
country behind Constantinople as far as Chorlou, laid siege
to Rodosto, and killed all whom they found outside the
walls. Those who could escape took refuge in Constantinople.
Pachymer states that the Spaniards claimed to have killed
five thousand of these peasants. Adrianople was besieged
and, though it was not captured, the army of the Alans,
who had once more joined the Greeks, was defeated, the
vineyards around the city were rooted up and the fertile
country converted for the time into a desert. When the
emperor again made an effort to buy the Spaniards off he
found their terms higher than ever, on account of their
success. They not only demanded heavy payments for
services never performed, but that the Emperor should pay
ransom for the towns, the fortresses and prisoners captured
by them.</p>

<p>The two divisions of Spaniards, one under Rocafert, who
had been appointed to succeed Roger, and the other under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Fernand Ximenes, were now acting separately, and while the
negotiations were going on the former set out for Constantinople.
They were, however, resisted by the imperial troops
and compelled to retire. They continued under Rocafert to
devastate Thrace. As they themselves received no food
from abroad nor tilled the ground in Thrace and had already
devastated the country, they were at length forced to retreat
from want of provisions to Gallipoli.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissension
in the
Grand
Company.</div>

<p>Happily, serious divisions arose between the Spaniards
themselves. A large number of them refused to recognise
Rocafert who had been named leader with the consent of
Ximenes. On the other hand, Rocafert declared that as he
had conquered the country he had no intention of abandoning
the leadership. The influence of Guy, the nephew of the
king of Sicily, who had brought with him another detachment
of foreign freebooters in seven large ships and who counted
upon utilising the Grand Company for the re-establishment of
the Latin empire in his own family, was unable to settle
the differences between the two parties, and they were soon
at open war with each other. On one side was Rocafert,
on the other were Guy, Ximenes, and Berenger, who had
been released by the Genoese.</p>

<p>In view of an attack by the imperial troops and of the
necessity of finding provisions, a peace was patched up
between the two Spanish factions, and they started in a body
to attack Salonica and plunder Macedonia. The six thousand
Spaniards were accompanied by three thousand Turks.
Rocafert’s division led. The van of the second division
reached the camping ground of the first before it had been
completely evacuated, and the two armies at once began
fighting each other. Berenger hastened to put an end to the
quarrel and was killed by Rocafert’s brother. Ximenes was
captured. Rocafert was now the sole leader. He attempted
to capture Salonica but failed. He then retreated in order to
return to Thrace: but his position was growing weak. He
appealed to a French admiral, who had arrived in the northern
Aegean as the precursor of the expected great expedition
from the West, for his intervention with the Spaniards who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
distrusted him, but the admiral seized and carried him off to
the king of Naples, where he was thrown into prison and
starved to death.</p>

<p>When the partisans of Rocafert in the Grand Company
learned of what they regarded as the treachery of the French
admiral, they murdered their officers under the belief that
they were parties to the capture. They elected new leaders,
marched into Thessaly, and took service with the descendants
of the crusading barons who had carved out territories for
themselves in that province and in Greece. It is unnecessary
to follow them there. It is sufficient to say that the Greek
army had dogged their movements, had fought well, had
<span class="sidenote">Its end,
1315.</span>defeated them in many engagements, and that what may be
regarded as the last struggle with the Grand Company took
place in 1315.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disastrous
results
from
attempts
to restore
empire.</div>

<p>The devastation caused by the attempts from the West
to re-establish the Latin empire culminating in the disorders
caused by the Grand Company was such that the
empire’s chances of recovering its strength were enormously
diminished. The fall of the city in 1204 had been followed
by the destruction of the organisation in Asia Minor for resisting
the progress of Asiatic hordes towards Europe. One may
conjecture that the great statesman Innocent the Third, who
had foreseen some of the evil effects which would inevitably
follow from the success of Dandolo and Montferrat, would
have realised the necessity of aiding Constantinople in making
such resistance. Unfortunately, Innocent’s successors
were less statesmanlike. Instead of seeking to strengthen
the Greeks in Constantinople by condemning the wild
lawlessness of the Spaniards, their dominating idea was to
restore the Latin empire, so as to force the members of the
Orthodox Church to enter into Union. The results of all their
attempts were altogether disastrous. The empire was
weakened on every side. Its component parts had always
been loosely bound together. Long distances in ages of
badly constructed roads had prevented the development of
loyalty as a bond of union. The traditional attachment to
the autocrat at Constantinople had been shaken by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
change of dynasties. Peasants living far away from the
capital, who had no other desire than to till their lands in
peace, were ready to accept the rule of a Serbian or a Bulgarian,
of a powerful rebel against the empire or even of the Turks
themselves, provided they were undisturbed. Those who were
in the neighbourhood of the capital were in worse plight.
The development of trade and commerce had been hindered.
Thrace had become a desolation. During five years the
Spaniards had lived on the country and only deserted it
when there remained nothing further to plunder. The
thriving communities extending along all the northern
shores of the Marmora from the city to Gallipoli were impoverished
or destroyed. Flourishing vineyards and oliveyards
were abandoned. The fishing and shipping communities
ceased to find occupation. Great numbers of the
inhabitants were exterminated.</p>

<p>The richest city in Europe had become poverty-stricken.
The coinage, which for centuries had served as the standard
for the whole Western world, had been debased in order to
find money to pay foreign mercenaries. Worse than all,
while the empire had been employed in resisting these
invaders from the West, the Bulgarians, Serbians, and, far
more important than either, the Turks had gained strength
and had enormously enlarged their territories.</p>

<p>To the Catalan Grand Company must be attributed
the introduction of the first body of Turks into Europe.
It might have been expected that the traditions of Spaniards
would have influenced them sufficiently to have refused
Moslem aid, that Western Europe would have raised the
cry of treason to Christendom when it learned that bands of
Turks had been engaged to fight against a Christian though a
schismatic emperor; but the filibusters who had been invited
into the empire for the defence of Christendom thought only
of plunder, and Western Europe was either indifferent or
thought there was little to choose between schismatics and
Moslems.</p>

<p>The attempts to restore the Latin empire had failed, but
the emperor and his people were in presence of a much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
more formidable enemy than the West had furnished. The
Asiatic hordes whom the city had successfully resisted for a
century and a half before its capture were now constantly
encroaching on imperial territory. As these hordes were
destined to be the destroyers of the Empire, I propose next
briefly to notice their origin and history.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great central plains of Asia, stretching almost without
an interruption from the Caspian Sea to China, have during
all historical time produced hardy races of nomad warriors.
On the three occasions in their history when they have
found skilful leaders, their progress as conquerors has been
epoch-marking. Twice their progress has been westward.
Mounted warriors and hordes of foot soldiers made their
way towards the Euxine, some going to the north and
others to the south of that sea. The first of these waves of
<span class="sidenote">Genghis
Khan
moves
westward.</span>population thus moving westward was that led by Genghis
Khan, a Mongol belonging to the smallest of the four great
divisions of the Tartar<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> race. His followers were, however,
mainly Turks, the most widely spread of these divisions.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
He had established his rule before 1227, the year in which
he died, from the Sea of Japan to the Dnieper. He and his
immediate successors ravaged a greater extent of territory
than any other conqueror. Like Alexander the Great, he and
they advanced with regularly organised armies, with apparently
no other object than conquest and plunder. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>victories facilitated the migration of his own subjects into the
newly conquered territories and hastened the departure of
large bodies of men, who fled before the terrible massacres
which marked the progress of their ever victorious armies.</p>

<p>A branch of the same great horde, under the leadership
of Subutai, destroyed Moscow and Kiev in a campaign conducted
with striking ability and ending in 1239, and settled
in Russia. Poland, aided by French Knights Templars and
the Grand Master of the Teutonic order, had put forward all
her strength to resist the same division of the all-devouring
army, while another wing attacked the Hungarians with
half a million of men.</p>

<p>Their entry into Europe was in such numbers and the
excesses of cruelty committed by them were so alarming
that their advance everywhere created terror. The Tartars&mdash;coming
from Tartarus, as some of the Crusaders believed&mdash;were
so little known, says Pachymer, that many declared
they had the heads of dogs and fed upon human flesh.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
Seen nearer, they were less formidable as individuals, though
infernal, terrible, and invincible as an army.</p>

<p>In 1258, the year before the recapture of Constantinople
and the destruction of the Latin empire by the Greeks,
Houlagou, the grandson of Genghis Khan, captured Bagdad,
and deposed the last of the Bagdad caliphs. He extended
his conquests over Mesopotamia and Syria to the Mediterranean.
Damascus and Aleppo were sacked. Houlagou
sought to ally himself with the Crusaders in order to overthrow
the Saracens and the sultan of Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Seljukian
Turks.</div>

<p>When Houlagou turned his attention to Asia Minor, he
found among the Christian populations a division of the
Turkish race known as Seljuks, whose sultan resided at
Konia, and called himself sultan of Roum.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> He attacked
and inflicted injuries upon them from which they never
recovered. It is difficult to state precisely what were the
boundaries of the Seljuks and of other Moslem or partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>Moslem peoples in Asia Minor and Syria, during the thirteenth
century, and this difficulty arises from the fact that
their boundaries were continually changing. The Saracens
held certain places in Syria, but there was a Christian
prince in Antioch; there were cities occupied by the western
Knights Templars, a Christian prince in Caramania and a
king of Lesser Armenia. There were Turcomans at Marash
and in the hill country behind Trebizond, and Kurds invaded
Cilicia in 1278. A large tract of country around Konia was
ruled over by the Seljuks. No natural boundary marked the
extent of territory occupied by any of these peoples or in
Asia Minor by the Roman emperor.</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that the entry of the armies of
the followers of Genghis Khan, continually renewed by the
arrival of new hordes from Central Asia, changed the distribution
of the peoples and spread terror everywhere at
their approach. Even at Nicaea, within sixty miles of Constantinople,
the rumour in 1267 of the arrival of a Tartar
army caused a terrible panic.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Two years later the Tartars
attacked the Saracens in Syria, whither they had been invited
for such purpose by the Christians, defeated them, and
carried off a rich booty. For a while they were a terror
alike to Moslems and Christians. As from the followers of
Genghis Khan there ultimately came the race of Ottoman
Turks who conquered New Rome and its empire, it is
desirable to consider them somewhat carefully.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Characteristics
of
Asiatic
invaders.</div>

<p>It is important to note that the first hordes who came in
with the great conqueror and those who followed for at least
a century were not Mahometan fanatics. Some of their
leading generals were indeed Christians. Genghis himself
had married a Christian wife. Mango Khan (1251–1259),
one of his successors, is described by Maundeville, who
visited Palestine in 1322, as ‘a good Christian man, who was
baptized and gave letters of perpetual peace to all Christian
men,’ and sent to win the Holy Land to put it into the
hands of the Christians and destroy the law of Mahomet.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
His great successor, Houlagou, was the husband of the
granddaughter of the famous Prester (or Presbyter) John,
the king of a Christian state in Central Asia, visited by
Marco Polo.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> The army led by Houlagou contained
Mahometans, but it contained also Christians, Buddhists, and
professors of other creeds. Central Asiatics had up to the
time which concerns us not developed any violent religious
animosity. Christians, Moslems, and Buddhists dwelt together
in harmony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not
fanatical.</div>

<p>It is probably correct to say that the races of the great
plains of Asia have never been religiously disposed. Mr.
Schuyler, who was a keen observer, remarked, less than a
generation ago, that the people which had been recently
conquered by Russia in Central Asia were classified as to
their religion with extreme difficulty. A few declared themselves
Christians. The remainder were indiscriminately
inscribed as Moslems, but very few among them really knew
anything about the religion of Islam and did not even consider
themselves as Moslems.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> The fierce fanaticism which
the early followers of Mahomet displayed and which led
them within a century after his death to make the most
wonderful and enduring series of conquests which have ever
been accomplished by a people whose sole bond of union
was religion was not shown by the followers of Genghis.
They preferred to fight the Saracens and to aid the Christians
rather than to do the reverse. We shall see that when,
a century and a half later, another great invasion from Central
Asia took place, its leader Timour the Lame’s greatest
activity was directed against the Mahometans, and that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>demanded from them the restoration to the Christian
emperor of the cities which they had captured.</p>

<p>It is true that in the interval between the two invasions
under Genghis Khan and Timour, the Turkish invaders, who
had remained in Asia Minor, caught much of the fanatical
spirit. But there are many indications which show that this
spirit was of slow growth.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> As their struggles with neighbouring
and Christian peoples compacted them into a warlike
nation, they all came to accept the religion of Mahomet,
and as they became better acquainted with the tenets of the
most war-inspiring religion in the world, they held to them
tenaciously, and developed the hostility towards Christians
which the spiritual pride of believers who consider themselves
the elect of heaven, and their religion outside the
range of discussion, always engenders. But during the
development of their power in Asia Minor, many years
passed before they isolated themselves, and were isolated
from the Christians, on account of their religion. Their
princes sought marriage with the princesses of the imperial
and other noble Christian families. We obtain light only
incidentally upon the relations between the professors of the
two creeds at the period shortly after the recapture of
Constantinople by the Greeks. But such as we do obtain
confirms the statement that the Asiatic settlers took their
religion very easily. In 1267 certain charges were brought,
as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> by the Emperor Michael against the
patriarch, which give us a glimpse of interest. The relation
is made by Pachymer, who was himself one of the clerks of
the court. The patriarch was accused, not only of having
conversed familiarly with a Turkish sultan, of having
allowed him and his companions to use the bath attached
to the church, around which were the Christian symbols,
but of having ordered a monk to administer the Sacrament
to the children of the sultan without having been assured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>that they were baptized. He was charged, further, with
having said the Litanies with the sultan and his followers.
The patriarch replied to the two first with contempt; if the
Turks had used the church bath, no harm had been done.
As to giving Communion, he declared that he had been duly
certified that the children had been baptized.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Witnesses
asserted that it was true that the accused had said the
Litanies with the sultan, and that he had allowed him to
sit by his side during celebration, but added that they did
not know whether the sultan was a Christian or not!
Other persons were found who declared that he was not a
Christian. The sultan, hearing of the proceedings, sent to
ask, either in jest or seriously, that the emperor would give
him the sacred relics which he wore round his neck, and
offered to eat ham as a proof that he was not a Moslem.
Pachymer adds that in thus professing his readiness to
worship the relics and to eat the forbidden flesh, the sultan
caused the proceedings against the patriarch to fail. As it
appeared that there were eminent ecclesiastics in the court
who really believed that the sultan of the Turks was a
Christian, those who desired the condemnation of the
patriarch tried to turn the question by suggesting that,
whether he was Christian or not, it was certain that members
of his suite, who had been present when Communion
was administered, were unbelievers.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> That the sultan
should have been present at a Christian service at all, that
his children should have been allowed by him or his Moslem
followers to communicate, and that his children were baptized,
or believed to be baptized, show that, whether they
were Christians or not, the fanatical spirit which animated
the Moslems of an earlier period, or the Turks a century
later, was not present among these representatives of the
Asiatics who had entered the country as followers of Genghis
or his immediate successors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Permanent
characteristics
of Turkish
race.</div>

<p>The characteristics of the Turk have remained singularly
like those possessed by his ancestors. The Turkish soldiers
who had come in with Genghis, and the hordes of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>who followed during a century, had been for the most part
wandering shepherds, and the nomadic instinct still continued,
and still continues, in the race, notwithstanding that
there has been a considerable admixture of other races.
The tent of their leader was larger than that of his followers,
and its entrance came, in the course of time, to be known as
The Lofty Gate, or The Sublime Porte. The shepherd
warriors, who were destined to destroy the empire of the
New Rome, had few of the desires, habits, or aspirations of
civilisation. Commerce, except in its simplest form of
barter, was and has always been almost unknown to them.
Among the Turks of a later period the disinclination to
change the traditional habits of the race is to some extent
due to the indifference or contempt felt for trading communities
by a race of conquerors; though, perhaps, incapacity
to hold their own as traders against the peoples they
subdued has had a larger share in producing their aversion
to commerce. The furniture of their huts is even yet only
such as would have been found in their felt tents. They
have no desire to possess the ordinary utensils which
Europeans of every race consider either as the necessaries of
life or as adding largely to its comfort. They have never
taken kindly to agriculture. Surrounded by fertile land, the
Turk will till only enough to supply him with the barest
necessaries of life, and the traveller in the interior of Asia
Minor is to-day, as he has been for centuries, astonished to
see that Turkish peasants who, as the owners of large tracts
of fertile land, capable of producing almost any fruits or
vegetables, and of supporting even a large number of cattle,
may be accounted wealthy, are yet content to live upon fare
and amid surroundings at which the ordinary European
peasant, and even the Turks’ own neighbours of different
races, would express their dissatisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>
<p>We get few glimpses of the domestic life and manners of
the Turks during the first two centuries of their emigration
into Asia Minor. But such as we gain show them, in peace
and war, to possess the same characteristics as distinguish
their descendants at the present day. When not under the
influence of their religion they are peaceful, kindly disposed,
and truthful. In the hospitality of the tent or hut they are
irreproachable. They possess little, but that little is at the
disposal of the traveller. Judged by Western ideas, they are
lazy, and lacking in intelligence. In the ordinary business
of life they are singularly destitute of energy. They have
learned, like their fathers, to be content with the poverty
amid which they were born. They have not sufficient
capacity to desire knowledge nor aspiration to make them
discontented. If, as I believe the evidence to indicate, the
ancestors of the present Moslems in Asia Minor were
during the thirteenth and half of the fourteenth century
but little under the influence of religious fanaticism, their
easy-going, <i>dolce far niente</i> character may well be taken as
sufficient explanation of the passing over into Turkish
territories of many Christians who desired to escape from
the heavy taxation under the rule of the Christian emperors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constant
stream of
immigrants
from
Central
Asia.</div>

<p>In describing the movement of the Asiatic races into
Asia Minor and Europe, but especially of the advance of the
Turkish hordes who came after the death of Genghis, two
facts ought never to be lost sight of. The first and most
important is that from a period even preceding the recapture
of the city in 1259 down to one within the memory of living
men there was a constant stream of immigrants from
Central Asia westward. The numbers of the immigrant
settlers were thus steadily being increased. Probably at no
time has the Turkish race been as prolific as the Christian
races of Asia Minor, and the latter would long ago have
outnumbered the conquering race had the stream of immigration
been dammed. The second fact to be noted is that
a constant settlement of the conquered lands was being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">All conquests
followed by
settlement.</span>made, a settlement which, although possibly as nomadic and
uncertain as that of the Kurds and Yuruks of to-day, was
yet a real occupation of the country at the expense of
Christian populations, who were either massacred or dispersed.
It is in the nomadic character of the newcomers, in
the wasteful character of their occupation of the country, in
the substitution of sheep and cattle industry for agriculture,
in their want of intelligence, and in their expulsion and
persecution of the Christian population, that the explanation
is to be found of the destruction and, in some cases, complete
abandonment of cities still populous and flourishing when
they were captured: cities like Ephesus, Nicaea, and a
hundred others, whose ruins meet the traveller everywhere
throughout Asia Minor. The Turk has at all times been a
nomad and a destroyer. He has never been a capable
trader or even agriculturist.</p>

<p>When the armies led by Genghis Khan and his successors
retired, armies which were well disciplined and well led,
many of his soldiers or their followers remained and took
service with the Seljukian Turks. Others formed separate
communities. One of the chiefs who thus settled in Asia
Minor was Ertogrul or Orthogrul, the father of Osman or
Othman, the founder of the Ottoman dynasty.</p>

<p>During Ertogrul’s life, the Seljuks had been greatly
harassed by the newer invaders. Pachymer states that
on the arrival of the Tartars the sultan of Konia (the
ancient Iconium) was surrounded by enemies, and that he
had sought the protection of the emperor. He had invited
also the aid of the sultan of Egypt, known to the Crusaders
as the sultan of Babylon, against the Tartars, by whom he
was hard pressed. Three or four years after this sultan’s
death in 1277, Ertogrul died. His son Osman or Othman
by his courage and ability gave his followers the leading
place among the Turks in Asia Minor and firmly established
the dynasty named after him. He began his career by
coming to an agreement with some of the other Moslem
chiefs to divide the territory occupied by the Seljuks and
themselves in Asia Minor into eight portions. Thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the combined forces of the old and new Turks commenced
a series of attacks upon neighbouring territory. During the
next twenty years, their success was almost unchecked.
In 1282, they laid siege to Tralles (the present Aidin), and,
though opposed by the son of Michael the Eighth, were
able to capture and destroy the city.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> A short time afterwards
they obtained a fleet and took into their service a large
number of sailors who had been discharged by the emperor
from motives of economy. Twelve years later, Othman and
Ali, chief of another Turkish band, pushed their raids northward
and even crossed the river Sangarius and spread desolation
throughout the Asiatic provinces of the Empire,
before they could be driven back. Two years later, they
laid waste the country between the Black Sea and Rhodes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Othman,
first Ottoman
Sultan,
1299–1327.</div>

<p>In 1299, Othman took the title of Sultan. In 1302, he
and other Turkish leaders inflicted a serious defeat upon
the imperial troops and a band of Alans on the river
Sangarius near Sabanja. The defeat was shortly afterwards
turned into a rout and the subjects of the empire with the
Alans were driven to seek shelter in Ismidt, the ancient
Nicomedia. The confines of the empire were narrowed,
and Othman established himself near Brousa and the neighbouring
city of Nicaea, and came to an arrangement for
division of the newly acquired territory with the other
Turkish chiefs.</p>

<p>Alarmed for a while at the news that the emperor was
to receive help from the West, the Turks soon renewed
their attacks upon imperial territory, and the Greek population
almost everywhere fled before them. They attacked
the wealthy cities on the Aegean coast of Asia Minor
and occupied several of the islands of the Archipelago.
Pachymer states<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> that they had inundated the country north
of Pergamus so completely that no Roman dared entertain
the hope of keeping his property, and all fled before the
flood of invaders: some to the city of Pergamus, others to
Adramyttium or Lampsacus, while others again crossed the
Dardanelles into Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>The reign of Othman is contemporaneous with one of
the great periods of immigration from Central Asia. The
numbers of the Turks were yearly augmented by such
hordes that the Greek writers continually use metaphors
derived from the torrent, from floods and inundations, to
describe their overwhelming force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Entry of
Turks into
Europe,
1306–7.</div>

<p>It was partly in order to resist this flood of invasion
that the Catalan Grand Company had been invited to aid
the emperor, but after having won several victories over
the Turks, the lawlessness of the Spaniards forced the
emperor to recognise that his Western auxiliaries were of
no value for checking the progress of the enemy. The
Christians of Asia Minor flocked to the capital to avoid the
Company almost as much as to escape from the soldiers of
Othman. Worse than all, to these Christians of Spain must
be ascribed the introduction of the Turks into Europe. At
the invitation of the Company, a band of them, as we have
seen, crossed the Dardanelles to aid in attacking the empire
which Roger and his Catalans had come to defend. About
the same time, another band of Turks landed in Greece for
the purpose of pillage. These invasions are epoch-marking,
since from this time (1306–7), Europe was never entirely
free from the presence of Turks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their progress
in
Asia
Minor.</div>

<p>Their great progress was, however, more marked in Asia
Minor. In 1308, one of the divisions of Turks not under
Othman captured Ephesus, which surrendered to avoid
massacre. The city still retained something of its ancient
glory. Its famous church of St. John, from the ruins of
which the traveller may still gain an idea of its former
magnificence, was plundered, and its immense wealth in
precious vessels and deposits became the prey of the victors.
Many of the inhabitants were cruelly massacred, notwithstanding
their submission, and the remainder were driven
away as fugitives to find the means of living where they
could or to starve. Other places under the rule of Constantinople
were attacked, and though many victories were
gained&mdash;for the imperial troops fought well&mdash;the Turks were
constantly gaining cities and territory from the Christians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
It was in vain that the emperor entered into league with
bands of Tartars or with other Turks to attack the armies
of Othman, for the forces of this skilful leader were too
numerous to be subdued. Brousa had to purchase peace
from him. Othman failed, however, to capture Rhodes,
which was bravely defended by the military knights from
the West, and a monk named Hilarion at the head of the
imperial troops gained some successes. The imperial troops
succeeded also in 1310 in defeating a certain Mahomet whose
dominions were in Caramania. But even with the aid of
a band of Tartars who had allied themselves with the
emperor, who was in command of twenty thousand of the
imperial troops, little could be done to check Othman’s
steady progress.</p>

<p>Meantime in Europe, on the north shore of the Marmora,
the band of Turks who had been associated with the Grand
Company, but who did not acknowledge the rule of Othman,
besieged Ganos and laid waste the surrounding country.
The troubles which arose a few years later between the
Emperor Andronicus the Second and young Andronicus,
enabled the Turks steadily to encroach on the empire in Asia
Minor, and their introduction as partisans in the civil war
which went on in 1322 familiarised them and probably
Othman himself with inroads into the country between
Constantinople and Gallipoli.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>So far we have been concerned almost exclusively with
those portions of the Asiatic army and the hordes which
followed it which came westward to the south of the Black
Sea. But it must be noted that the body of invaders of the
same race who had come westward to the north of that sea,
and who had attacked Russia, Poland, and Hungary, had
constantly received additions to their numbers. This
northern division was possibly more numerous than the
Turks in Asia Minor. As early as 1265, a certain Timour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>the ruler of Tartars who were in occupation of territory on
the Volga, had sent twenty thousand men to aid the Bulgarians
against the Empire. Bulgarians and Tartars together
had occupied all the passes into Thrace, and the emperor had
saved himself with difficulty. In 1284, ten thousand Tartars
came southward into Thrace from the great host which were
in Hungary. In 1300, the Turks who had entered the Crimea
were driven out by another horde of Tartars who had
occupied South Russia. The number and strength of these
invaders continued constantly to increase. Their power
indeed remained firmly established in South Russia until
long after the conquest of Constantinople. They had no
special sympathy with the Ottoman Turks, and were ready,
as were the Alans, to fight either for the emperor or against
him. Cantacuzenus mentions that in 1324 one hundred
and twenty thousand of them entered Thrace and were
beaten in detail by his friend the young Andronicus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of

<p>Weakened by having to meet this huge northern army,

forbidden or was unable to go to the relief of Brousa when,

surrender in 1326 is a convenient mark of the progress made
by the Ottoman Turks.</p>

AID; REIGNS OF ANDRONICUS THE SECOND, JOHN CANTACUZENUS
AND JOHN; REPEATED FAILURE OF EFFORTS
BY POPES TO INDUCE WESTERN POWERS TO ASSIST IN
CHECKING MOSLEM ADVANCE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, in 1320, the Emperor Michael the Ninth died, the
empire was already threatened by large and ever-increasing
armies of Asiatics, both on the north and on the south. Those
on the south were steadily being incorporated into the group
ruled over by Othman.</p>

<p>The sixty years which had passed since the expulsion of
the Latins had nevertheless done something, though not
much, towards restoring the empire. Territory had been
recovered. The walls of the capital had been repaired. The
population had begun once again to look to the emperor at
Constantinople as their natural ruler.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Distressed
condition
of the
empire.</div>

<p>On the other hand the ravages of war had been terrible.
The population of those portions of the Balkan peninsula
which were under the rule of the empire had greatly
diminished. Thousands had been murdered by the Catalan
Grand Company and their allies during their successive
devastations of the country. Land had gone out of cultivation.
In Asia Minor many of the Christian inhabitants had
voluntarily submitted to the Turks to save their lives or to
obtain protection. The demand for soldiers to serve the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>national cause against the many enemies who attacked the
empire, and the demands for money which was needed for
the conduct of the defence, induced the peasants both in
Europe and Asia to escape into neighbouring territories
where such demands were less rigorous. The wealth of the
empire had largely diminished. The great need of the country
was peace. Peace and security for life and property were
absolutely essential if the empire were to be restored to prosperity.
The people were wearied of strife, and there are
indications which point to a general indifference as to what
became of the empire as a state. The peasant wanted to
till his land and reap his harvest in peace, the nobles to
gather their revenues in peace. The means of communication
between the provinces and the capital were too few to
enable the mass of the people to take an interest in what
was passing in the capital. They had come to regard it not
so much as their protector but as the place from whence
emanated new exactions, new demands for military service,
and general harassment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the dynastic struggles which were destined
to come strengthened this desire for peace, increased the
indifference as to who was their emperor, and still further
weakened the empire.</p>

<p>The greatest misfortune which the struggle with the
Spaniards had brought about was the introduction of the
Turk into Europe. We have seen that each side, Orthodox
emperors and Catholic invaders, had allied themselves with
bands of Turks and other barbarians, who had overrun
Thrace and Macedonia. The destruction of the population,
the raiding of their cattle, and the laying waste of fertile
lands offered at once a facility and an incentive to the
Moslem invaders to remain in Europe. Indeed, from the
first entry of the Turks bands of nomads of that race began
to occupy portions of the desolated country.</p>

<p>For the next hundred and thirty years&mdash;that is, until the
Moslem conquest&mdash;the history of the empire is, so far as its
rulers are concerned, largely one of confused struggle during
which no man of conspicuous ability came to the front. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
account for this confusion it should be noted that there was
no rule of succession to the throne which was regarded as
inviolable, and that, even among the nobles and in the
Church, public opinion had little force except upon religious
questions. A few men in the city took an interest in political
questions; the great mass of the peasants took none.
Representative institutions did not exist. The reigning
emperor, though in theory absolute, was largely controlled
by irresponsible and unorganised nobles. When a majority
of them agreed to support a rival candidate they were
sufficiently powerful to have their own way. The result was
that dynastic struggles where each rival for the throne was
supported by a party of patricians were frequent, and these
struggles contributed very largely to weaken the empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quarrels
between
Andronicus
the
Second and
his grandson.</div>

<p>On the death of the co-Emperor Michael the Ninth,
his father, Andronicus the Second, still occupied the imperial
throne. Being now well advanced in years, he desired, on
the death of his son, to break through the engagement by which
Andronicus, his grandson, the son of Michael, should become
with him joint occupant of the throne. The relations
between the two men were far from friendly. While insisting
that his grandson should present himself at the court,
the old emperor refused for four months to speak to him.
The grandson, usually known as Young Andronicus, was
supported by a powerful party and had no intention of
abandoning what he considered to be his rights. In order
to get rid of him, the emperor formally brought a charge
of treason and sought to put him upon his trial, but
Cantacuzenus, the most distinguished noble, and his other
friends rallied to the palace in such force that the elder
Andronicus was alarmed. In presence of the patriarch and
the nobles on whom he could rely, the emperor accused his
grandson of continual disobedience, and proceeded as if to
pass sentence. ‘This is why’ he began&mdash;but here Young
Andronicus stopped him, asking to be allowed to defend
himself. The scene as described by his great friend and
most powerful supporter, Cantacuzenus, is a striking one.
The young man is seated on the chair and in the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
assigned to accused persons. He admits amid the silence
of the court that he has disobeyed his grandfather in such
trivial matters as going out hunting, attending races, and the
like, but claimed that he had done nothing against the
emperor’s interest, and asked to be sent before independent
judges. The old man tried to shout him down, and roared
out that he believed he was not even a Christian. Young
Andronicus replied with spirit and claimed that he should
be tried. ‘If you have made up your mind to condemn me
without hearing, do with me what you like and at once. If
not, judge me according to law.’ That was a reply which
still appealed to all men in the city of Justinian.</p>

<p>When the emperor had shouted at his grandson, the
friends of Young Andronicus, who had been near but in
hiding, believing he was condemned, came forward for his
defence. A courtier warned the emperor of their presence,
telling him, says Cantacuzenus, that they were ready to do
all that was necessary for his grandson’s safety. Thereupon
the emperor retired and sent word that he would pardon
him. A reconciliation was patched up, but it was only
temporary. After the lapse of a few weeks grandfather and
grandson were again openly hostile to each other. The
young man was forbidden to enter the capital, where he had
many supporters, and the two emperors remained enemies
for years. In 1326 two officers in command of the towers
above the Romanus Gate enabled him to effect a surprise.
The gates were opened and the elder Andronicus became
virtually a prisoner until his death. The contest between
them had lasted upwards of six years.</p>

<p>In 1328 the elder emperor abdicated and entered a
monastery, and two years afterwards the burial of a monk
named Anthony marked the end of the life of Andronicus the
Second. Andronicus the Third was now the sole occupant
of the throne, which he held until his death in 1341.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reign of
Andronicus
the
Third,
1328–1341.</div>

<p>During these thirteen years (1328–1341) war was constantly
being waged against the Turks. The emperor
himself was always in delicate health, and died at the age
of forty-five. He continued his great friendship until his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
death with Cantacuzenus, and invited him, even as early as
1329, to occupy the throne as co-emperor, and the offer
was renewed.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Cantacuzenus, notwithstanding that he was
pressed to accept by the only noble near him in rank,
Apocaukus, who afterwards became his great enemy, refused.
The emperor, however, continued to treat him as a friend,
and was constantly accompanied by him on his various
expeditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appeals for
aid to the
pope.</div>

<p>Like every emperor from the recapture of Constantinople
down to 1453, Andronicus turned his attention to the
West and sought to obtain aid against the Turks, even at the
price of coercing his people into a Union with Rome. The
Turks had invaded Macedonia and attacked Euboea and
Athens. As the southern portion of the Balkan peninsula was
still ruled in part by the descendants of the crusading barons
and by the remnant of the Catalans, there was reason to believe
that the pope would be ready to arouse the West against the
common enemy of Christendom. Accordingly the emperor
took advantage of the passage of Dominican missionaries
through Constantinople from Tartary to convey to Pope John
the Twenty-second his desire for Union and his request for
aid. The pope replied by sending preachers and by urging
the emperor to do all he could to accomplish his part. His
successor in 1335 grew alarmed at the attacks made by
the Turks by sea on various places in the Mediterranean,
and finding that the Catalans had seized Athens from
Gautier de Brienne, who held it as his duchy, he excommunicated
them. He invited Andronicus to join the king
of France and Naples in a Crusade against the Turks which
the Venetians and the Genoese had promised also to aid.
The emperor gladly gave his consent and sent a number
of ships, but the needs of Cyprus, which was being attacked
by the Saracens, were decided to be more pressing than those
of the empire, and the Crusade was not proceeded with.
Andronicus in 1339 sent Barlaam, the author of many controversial
works, to the pope, at that time in Avignon. On
his arrival he pointed out that the Turks had seized the seats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>of four metropolitan sees, and he suggested that as a condition
of the Union of the Churches the Turks should be expelled
from Asia Minor. The pope recognised the desirability of
such an attempt as keenly as many of his successors, but saw
that the condition was impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Andronicus
the
Third.
Reign of
John (1341
to 1391),
Cantacuzenus
(1342
to 1355.)</div>

<p>Andronicus on his death, in 1341, left a son, John
Palaeologus, who was then nine years old. His mother,
Anne of Savoy, was a woman of ability and energy. Cantacuzenus
was associated with her as regent. He held the
dignity of Grand Domestic, and in the later years of his life
wrote a clear and able statement of the history of his own
times. He had been, as we have seen, the intimate friend of
Andronicus and his great supporter when the grandfather of
the same name endeavoured to exclude him from the throne.
He had been named by his friend and patron as the guardian
of John, but the widow of the emperor was from the first
jealous of her co-guardian and never worked sympathetically
with him. He tells us that from the death of Andronicus he
was constantly urged to occupy the imperial throne and that
he as constantly refused. He undoubtedly possessed the confidence
of a large majority of the nobles. There was a general
recognition that, in the existing state of the empire, it was
unwise to leave the government in the hands of a boy and
of a foreign princess. Ducas expressly states that Cantacuzenus
ultimately allowed himself to be proclaimed emperor
because his friends urged him to take the reins of
government from the hands of a woman and a child and
because the empress and the senate were unjust and unfair
to him.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> In 1342 he was proclaimed joint emperor under
the style of John Cantacuzenus.</p>

<p>During the thirteen years of his reign, which lasted till
1355, the history of the empire is in the main one of civil
war and consequent decadence. Distrusted by Anne, the
mother of the boy emperor, his difficulties were increased by
the turbulent character of his ward, whom his mother could
not, or would not, restrain from wilfulness which led him
even in early youth into debauchery. The result was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>during the whole of Cantacuzenus’s reign there was a
constant strain between the elder emperor, on the one side,
and the empress and her son on the other. Cantacuzenus
states that Apocaukus, the noble next to himself in rank,
had suggested to him that he should assume imperial
authority and that he had rejected the suggestion as treason
to the empress and her sons and to the memory of the
emperor. But Apocaukus, with the support of the patriarch,
soon formed a party, nominally for the empress and her son,
really against Cantacuzenus. The patriarch himself claimed
to be the guardian of the infant John, excommunicated those
who abandoned him, and even Cantacuzenus himself.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> The
account given by the emperor of his reluctance to accept
the crown might be regarded with distrust if Nicephorus
Gregoras, who after he had become a bitter enemy wrote his
history of the events of the reign, were not on this point in
substantial accord with Cantacuzenus. Even before his
accession the troops, according to Gregoras, declared that
they would recognise no other regent than the Grand
Domestic, and proposed to make the oath of fidelity to the
young emperor and his mother conditional upon the recognition
of Cantacuzenus as tutor of John and regent of the
empire.</p>

<p>In presence of the opposition of Anne, Cantacuzenus
offered to resign, but the empress desired that he should
remain, probably fearing revolt in case his resolution was
carried into effect. Among much which is doubtful, it is
clear that he had the confidence of the army and that the
empress had not.</p>

<p>Civil war soon broke out between the new emperor and
the partisans of John and his mother. Apocaukus was
named governor of Constantinople by Anne and excited the
population against Cantacuzenus apparently with the intention
of having himself elected emperor by a popular vote.</p>

<p>Meantime the rivalries of these two nobles allowed foreign
enemies to make progress. Two divisions of Turks were
ravaging the empire in one direction, while a band of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Tartars who had crossed the Danube had advanced as far as
Didymotica. Stephen of Serbia had already marched southwards
and was rapidly consolidating the strength of his
country. In 1344 the discontent at the civil war had
become so great that the nobles insisted that the empress
Anne and Apocaukus should send an embassy to Cantacuzenus
to make peace. When this attempt failed, Apocaukus,
according to Cantacuzenus, endeavoured on two occasions to
have him assassinated. Driven thus to extremities, the
emperor promised his daughter Theodora in marriage to
the Turk Orchan, the son and successor of Othman, who
thereupon sent an army of five thousand men to assist in
the struggle against the partisans of John.</p>

<p>Apocaukus had thrown into the prisons of Constantinople
the partisans of his rival and had ordered them to be treated
with unusual barbarity. He was then incautious enough to
venture into prison among them. They fell upon him, slew
him, stuck his head upon a spike, and showed it to the citizens.
Next day, however, at the instigation of his widow, the
prisoners were all killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marriage
of Sultan
Orchan
and the
daughter
of the
emperor.</div>

<p>In 1346 Orchan was married to Theodora, the daughter
of Cantacuzenus. Her father had stipulated that she should
be allowed to remain a Christian, and the agreement was not
violated. She was delivered at Selymbria to the escort of
Turkish cavalry which had been commissioned to accompany
her. Amid much pomp and ceremony, with music, torches,
and display of various kinds, the first imperial princess of the
Orthodox Church was handed over to the eunuchs of her
barbarous lord. We may pass over the father’s excuses for
consenting to this marriage, which doubtless appeared to
many of his subjects a gross act of wickedness. All that
they amount to is that he believed the necessities of state
required him to obtain the aid of Orchan and that it could
not be obtained in any other way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marriage
of the
emperor
John to
another
daughter
of Cantacuzenus.</div>

<p>The next year, a much more promising marriage took
place, namely that of his daughter Helen with the young
emperor John Palaeologus. It had been brought about in
the following manner. Cantacuzenus had approached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
capital, and though the empress had been warned that he
was in the neighbourhood, she had taken no precaution to
prevent his being admitted, believing, indeed, that the story
of his being near was an invention to gain time so as to
prevent the condemnation of a new patriarch who was known
to be a partisan of Cantacuzenus and was then on his trial
before a Council of the Church. The friends of Cantacuzenus
were in possession of the Golden Gate and opened it to him
and his band of a thousand trusted followers. He marched
in triumph to the Palace of Porphyrogenitus. The empress,
as soon as she heard of the entry, shut herself up in the
Palace at Blachern and called to her aid the Genoese of
Galata. When the latter saw that the population were on
the side of her rival, they refused to aid her. John advised
his mother to treat, and after considerable hesitation she
consented and articles of peace were agreed to. An amnesty
was to be granted by both sides, and John was during ten
years to permit Cantacuzenus to be the dominant ruler.
Thereupon the latter proposed that his daughter Helen
should become engaged to John, and, though the young man
was unwilling, his mother accepted the arrangement. Helen
was thirteen years old and her proposed husband fifteen.</p>

<p>Peace and prosperity appear to have been anticipated
from the cessation of civil war which it was hoped this
marriage would produce. Europe, if not, as Gibbon asserts,
‘completely evacuated by the Moslems of Asia,’<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> was yet at
peace with the empire. Within its borders all parties were
supposed to be reconciled, and at the church of Blachern
(the <i>bema</i> of Hagia Sophia having been destroyed by an
earthquake) a remarkable coronation service was held in
May 1347. Two emperors, namely the young John
Palaeologus and John Cantacuzenus, and three empresses&mdash;Helen,
wife of the Palaeologus, Irene, wife of Cantacuzenus,
and Anne of Savoy, the dowager&mdash;were crowned with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>unusually elaborate ceremonial. The bystanders, however,
noted that the jewels were many of them false and the
trappings of far less value than had previously been displayed
on similar occasions.</p>

<p>Ducas notes that the young emperor, who had been
forced to marry the daughter of Cantacuzenus, instead of
taking part in the manly exercises of arms which were still
practised by the youth of the empire, plunged into debauchery
and soon disgusted his adherents by his drunkenness
and by the depravity of his private life. The narrative
of Gregoras declares that John complained bitterly of having
been insulted by his father-in-law, and the statement is probably
true that, seeing his debauchery, Cantacuzenus urged
him to lead a better life and devote himself to duty.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>Pressed as he was for money in every direction, Cantacuzenus
endeavoured to obtain it by a popular vote. The
notice of the incident is almost unique in the later history of
the empire and on that account merits attention. Cantacuzenus
himself tells its history. Finding that the state had
been greatly weakened by civil war, that the treasury was
empty, the cities reduced to poverty by domestic divisions
or by the invasions of the various foreign enemies who had
ravaged the country, and his own private fortune expended,
he determined to summon a meeting in Constantinople of
the wealthy classes in order that they should contribute to
the public necessities. He expressly states that he had no
intention of making a levy by force. In the meeting thus
called together there were representatives of all ranks&mdash;soldiers,
shopkeepers, artisans, heads of monasteries, and
priests. Cantacuzenus in addressing it declared that he had
no desire to act against the Palaeologi but recognised that
the civil war had exhausted the treasury, and promised that
the money collected would be employed and his efforts
directed against the attacks of Serbians, Bulgarians, and
Turks. He added that it was not he who had sought the
alliance of the Turks, though he had given his daughter in
marriage to Orchan, but that the aid of these barbarians had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>been forced upon him by his enemies within the empire.
The partisans of John had been the first to ask the Turks
for assistance. They had delivered cities to the Turks, had
paid them, and had made it necessary that he, in his own
defence, should ask for their alliance. He concluded by
urging the great assembly to consider in what manner
means might be found of preserving the empire.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>The nobles returned answer that they recognised the
necessity of contributing for the safety of the state, and
advised that every person should give what was in his power.
The emperor, believing that he had accomplished his purpose,
then dismissed the assembly.</p>

<p>Very little result appears to have been produced. Nor
does the voluntary taxation appear to have yielded any considerable
sum. In the meeting itself there were many who
were opposed to Cantacuzenus personally, and within a
short period the animosity between the partisans of the two
emperors became as rancorous as ever. Among the most
violent of his own partisans was his son Matthew, who,
under the belief that Anne, the empress-dowager, was conspiring
against his father, boldly took possession of several
cities.</p>

<p>Wearied out by constant struggle, Cantacuzenus states
that he wished to abdicate and retire to a monastery, and
that his wife approved of his design. His writings show
that he felt great interest in the discussion of theological
questions. The part which he himself took in several
religious controversies, the anxiety that he underwent to
have the excommunication against him annulled, first by
the Patriarch John and afterwards, ‘for greater safety,’ by
John’s successor,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Isidore, his negotiations with the pope
for Union, and many other circumstances, show that the
withdrawal to a monastery was a not unnatural development
of his life.</p>

<p>While he was making preparations to carry his design
into execution, news came of the progress of Stephen of
Serbia, which forced him to postpone it. Salonica, ‘one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>the eyes of the empire,’ was in danger of surrendering to
Stephen. The partisans of the Palaeologi among the
population of that city were numerous. The neighbouring
country was, however, under the power of the great Serbian,
and unless Stephen were checked without delay the city
would be given over to him. The old emperor sent word
to his followers to remain steadfast, promising that he would
come to their relief. In order to do so, he took a step which
is sometimes incorrectly treated as the first important introduction
of the Turks into Europe.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> He induced his son-in-law,
Orchan, to send a body of twenty thousand cavalry, under
his son Suliman, across the Dardanelles to march against
Stephen. The emperor left the capital as soon as he had
heard that the Turks had crossed the straits to co-operate
with them, and took his co-emperor John, who was obnoxious
to the Turks, with him. For some reason which is not clear,
the Othman or Ottoman Turks withdrew after they had
crossed the Maritza, but the two emperors with another body
of Turks went to Salonica and put an end to any design to
surrender it. This was in 1349.</p>

<p>The history of the empire during the next six years is
a medley of incidents, due to the hostility between the two
emperors. John refused to address his elder colleague as
emperor, and even proposed to join Stephen of Serbia,
whose power in the Balkan peninsula was now greater
than that of any other ruler. The Bulgarian king, appealed
to by Cantacuzenus to enter into alliance against Stephen,
refused his co-operation, and shortly after joined the Venetians
to attack the empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genoese
and
Venetians.</div>

<p>Cantacuzenus asked for the aid of the Genoese, who
joined him in order to resist the Venetians. The rivalry
during this reign between the two republics of Venice and
Genoa was great. Each was at the height of its power, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>the commerce and dominions of the empire were the
principal objects of their rivalry. A hundred and fifty years
earlier there had been colonies of Amalfians, Pisans,
Anconans, Ragusans, and even Germans, within the walls of
the city. All these had disappeared,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and Genoa the Superb
and Venice, Queen of the Seas, were the sole Italian competitors
for domination in or a share of the empire. At
the period with which we are concerned they were about
equally matched in strength, and the two brave republics
were constantly fighting the battles of their great duel in the
waters of the Greek empire. Within a few months the
Genoese were alternately the allies and the enemies of
Cantacuzenus. In 1350 a fleet of fourteen Venetian galleys,
and another of Catalans, prevented the Genoese from entering
the Bosporus. Two years later another formidable
fleet of Venetian galleys joined one of twenty-six Spaniards
in order to attack the Genoese. After Pisani, the Venetian
admiral, had rested his men for two days on the island of
Prinkipo, he joined the imperial ships at Heptaskalion, and
with a fleet of sixty-eight vessels attacked the Genoese.
The fleet of the latter, numbering seventy ships, was at
Chalcedon, and tried to intercept the enemy when they
endeavoured to make their way to the Golden Horn. In a
battle which was fought at the mouth of the Bosporus
while a strong south wind was blowing with a heavy sea&mdash;a
battle which continued all night&mdash;both sides lost heavily.
Eighteen Genoese ships were sunk. Pisani withdrew to
Therapia, with a loss of sixteen ships. Galata, held by the
Genoese, was not attacked, on account of the prevalence of
Black Death,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> or possibly because he heard that seventy or
eighty other galleys were on their way to aid the Genoese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately afterwards the Genoese joined with the
Turks, and transported across the Bosporus a body of
them to attack Constantinople. Cantacuzenus, in consequence,
was obliged to make peace with his rivals in Galata
by allowing them to include a large portion of additional
territory within new walls,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> as well as to take possession of
Selymbria and Heraclia in Thrace. The Genoese thereupon
once more became his allies. Orchan was ready to assist
him, and again promised to send twenty thousand Turks to
resist the party of John.</p>

<p>Once more Cantacuzenus endeavoured to come to terms
with his colleague. The latter had also endeavoured to gain
the aid of Orchan, but failed. John’s reply to the overture
of his father-in-law was again to refuse to recognise that he
had any right to the title of emperor. The followers of the
rival emperors, Cantacuzeni and Palaeologi, were more
bitter in their opposition than the leaders themselves, and
the former in 1353 proclaimed Matthew, the son of Cantacuzenus,
co-emperor with his father.</p>

<p>It is clear from the statement of Cantacuzenus himself
that, as John grew older, his own party became weaker.
The hopes of the people and of the nobles for a peaceful
reign had been disappointed. Instead of having peace, the
country had been disturbed by civil war. Serbia and Bulgaria
had both recovered strength. The Turks had encroached on
the imperial territories.</p>

<p>The emperor’s greatest offence was rightly considered to
have been the employment of Turkish auxiliaries, and the
permission granted to the captors to sell the captured
Christians as slaves, or the inability to prevent them from
doing so.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> The patriarch Philotheus remonstrated with
him on this account, and Cantacuzenus declares that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>received the admonition as the voice of God, and promised
to conform to it.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Probably because he recognised that his
own popularity was waning, he had allowed his eldest son,
Matthew, to be associated with him in the government, but
though the son displayed great activity, and gathered round
him a strong party, both he and his father were condemned
by the popular judgment.</p>

<p>The account given by Cantacuzenus is that he was
asked by the nobles to nominate his successor, that he
deferred giving his answer, but went to consult the patriarch,
who retired to a monastery and after a week sent word
that he would not return to the court nor to his church
unless the emperor would swear never to proclaim his son
Matthew. Thereupon Cantacuzenus called together the
senate, who declared for Matthew. Cantacuzenus protests
that in the struggle going on between John, his son-in-law,
and Matthew he was always neutral, but that as the
nobles wanted the latter he consented to name him as his
colleague and successor. Thereupon Matthew was allowed
to wear the purple buskin and the other imperial insignia.
His name, as well as that of his father and Anne, the
mother of John, was mentioned in the public prayers, while
that of John was omitted.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> The patriarch, however, remained
obdurate. Matthew had not yet been consecrated.
An assembly of bishops declared that, notwithstanding the
patriarch’s opposition, he ought to be asked to perform the
ceremony. The answer of Philotheus was to decree excommunication
against any one who should attempt to lay
upon him such a duty. The patriarch was threatened with
dismissal. He replied that he would be glad of it, and was
dismissed accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>The great anxiety of Cantacuzenus until, and even after,
his abdication was to see his son recognised as emperor.
Matthew, however, fell into the hands of John, who
generously offered him his liberty on condition that he
would renounce all claim to the throne. Cantacuzenus
states that he counselled his son to accept this offer. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>some hesitation he took his father’s advice. Articles of
peace were accepted, and among the stipulations it was
provided that Matthew might wear any buskin he liked
except in purple. It was a relief to both parties when John
saved himself from the reproaches of his father-in-law by
leaving for Italy and Germany. His party appears to have
increased in strength during his absence.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>He remained abroad for two years. On his return he
encountered at Tenedos a Genoese adventurer, with a considerable
number of followers, who was on the look-out for
an island which he might seize as the Venetians had seized
Chios. John proposed to employ the adventurer to aid him
in becoming sole emperor. They came together to Constantinople,
where the citizens had already risen in revolt
against Cantacuzenus, who had in consequence to shut himself
up in the Blachern Palace with a foreign guard. During
the night John’s friends asked to be admitted at the postern
of Hodegetria, pretending that they were merchants with a
cargo of olive oil, and that the sea was rising and dangerous.
They promised the guardians that if they were admitted
half the cargo should be paid for the favour. They rushed
the postern as soon as it was open, and two thousand men
entered the city, took possession of the walls, and made a
demonstration in favour of John. When morning broke,
the Hippodrome was crowded with citizens, and the city in
<span class="sidenote">Cantacuzenus
submits
and

Mount
Athos,
1355.</span>a tumult. Cantacuzenus apparently lost his head, entered
the monastery of Peribleptis, and assumed the habit of a
monk. He at once made submission to his young rival,
asked and, after some weeks, received permission to retire to
Mount Athos, and there passed nearly twenty-five years in the
composition of his voluminous History. He died in 1380.</p>

<p>Cantacuzenus, like his predecessors, looked to the West
and especially to the pope to aid him in checking the progress
of the Turks. Throughout the whole of his reign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>the attempts to obtain aid from the West and to bring
about the Union of the Churches, two objects which had
become inseparable, are constant. The zeal with which
successive popes sought to obtain the Union found a ready
response in Cantacuzenus.</p>

<p>News travelled slowly from the Levant to Italy, but such
as reached the West made it known, not merely that
Moslems were encroaching on Christian territory; that the
victories obtained in the great crusades had largely become
fruitless; that almost every inch of territory which had been
won in Syria at the sacrifice of so many lives and so much
treasure had been captured by the infidels, but that the
Christian populations had been everywhere treated with the
barbarity that has always followed Moslem conquest. The
history indeed of Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor had been a
long series of massacres, culminating perhaps in that of
Egypt where in 1354, when the Christians were ordered
to abjure their faith and to accept Mahometanism and
refused, a hundred thousand were put to death.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts
by pontiff
(<i>a</i>) to resist
Moslems,
(<i>b</i>) to
effect
union.</div>

<p>Under such circumstances, Clement the Sixth was not
less anxious than his predecessors had been to check
Moslem progress. Encompassed as he was with a host
of difficulties, and insecure even in his own position, he
constantly kept before him the desirability of attaining the
two results which for nearly three centuries were prominent
objects of papal policy: resistance to the Mahometans and
the Union of the two great Christian Churches. In 1343,
the year after his appointment to the pontifical throne, he
persuaded the queens of Sicily and Naples to send a fleet
with one fitted out by himself against the Turks. Two
years later he urged all Christians to aid in the defence of
Caifa and, in return for their services in defending that city,
permitted the Genoese to trade with the infidels at Bagdad.
When he learned that the Christian expedition which he
had authorised was massacred by the Turks near Smyrna,
he proclaimed a crusade and appealed to Edward the Third
of England not to prevent Philip of France from taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>part in it by making war against him, an appeal which was
unsuccessful and which was followed six months later by
the victory of Crécy. In the same year Clement sent two
nuncios into Armenia to persuade the members of the
ancient Church of that people to enter into union with
Rome. In 1347 he wrote to congratulate Stephen of Serbia
on his having expressed the desire to enter the Roman
Communion.</p>

<p>During the early years of the reigns of John and Cantacuzenus,
Clement does not appear to have had direct communication
with Constantinople. He had apparently a
dislike to or prejudice against the elder emperor, for in
1345 he wrote to the dauphin of France not to treat with
Cantacuzenus but only with the Dowager Empress Anne.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
He had seen with indignation the employment of Turks by
Cantacuzenus against his enemies and considered him a
usurper of the throne which ought to be occupied only
by John, the son of a mother whose predilections in favour
of Union were well known. His information, according to
the emperor’s narrative, was derived from an Italian lady
who had lived with the Empress Anne and whose sympathy
would naturally be with the cause of her mistress.</p>

<p>Cantacuzenus determined to explain to the pontiff his
own position, to justify his conduct and at the same time
to offer his aid in any expedition that might be formed for
attacking the Mahometans and to express his desire to
accomplish the Union of the Churches.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>Accordingly he sent a deputation to Clement consisting
of the protovestarius and an Italian in his service who was
known to the pope. On their arrival they had long interviews
with Clement and were astonished at his detailed
knowledge of the condition of the empire. According to
Cantacuzenus, the pope expressed great satisfaction at the
clemency shown by him to his enemies and especially at
the marriage between his daughter and John, in which he
saw the prospect of a united empire and one which would
be able to aid in resisting the Moslems. Clement sent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>deputation back to Constantinople accompanied by two
bishops as nuncios distinguished alike by their piety and
learning. They arrived in the capital in 1347. After
expressing the satisfaction of the pope for the emperor’s
moderation towards his enemies and his kindness towards
Anne, the nuncios declared that the pontiff was even more
zealous than any of his predecessors for an attack upon the
Turks and that he had already endeavoured to induce the
Italian princes to join in an expedition by promising them
aid in men and money, but that his zeal was still further
increased by the offer of the emperor to aid in such undertaking.
If in addition to this he could procure the reconciliation
of the Churches, he would gain the approval not
only of the pope but of God and His angels.</p>

<p>Cantacuzenus in his reply expressed his thanks to the
pontiff for his promised aid against the infidels and in
reference to the Union of the Churches declared that he
would willingly die if by his death he could secure the
object for which both ardently longed. He pointed out,
however, that the differences between the Churches related
to doctrine, and that Catholic teaching recognised that these
could only be settled by a Council of the whole Church.
He himself could accept no new dogmas nor force others
to accept them before they had been definitely accepted by
a Council. He therefore suggested that one should be
called, being confident that its deliberations and its decisions
would receive divine guidance. As the pope could
not come to Constantinople and Cantacuzenus could not
go to Rome, the emperor proposed that the Council should
be summoned to meet in some maritime city, midway between
the two capitals.</p>

<p>The nuncios found, or professed to find, the proposal of
the emperor reasonable, and returned to Rome. The pope
expressed his satisfaction, but declared that he could not
suggest a place of meeting till he had communicated with
the princes of the West. After some time he sent word
that though he regarded the Union of the Churches as the
most important question with which Christendom had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
deal, he was obliged to defer fixing the time and the place
for the Council until he had secured peace among the
Italian princes. The death of Clement, in 1352, delayed the
execution of this project.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of Cantacuzenus.</div>

<p>It is difficult to form an impartial judgment of the
characters of Cantacuzenus and John, whose reigns cover
the period during which, if it had been possible, the empire
might have recovered its strength. The history of the
reign written by the former, as well as the narrative of
Ducas, places the conduct of the elder emperor in a favourable
light. The charge most commonly brought against
him, of having introduced the Turks into Europe, can only
be accepted with considerable reserve. As we have already
seen, he was not the first to introduce them. The Spaniards
must bear the responsibility of this charge. Once it became
necessary to fight, whether against Serbians, Bulgarians, or
internal enemies, an emperor can hardly be blamed for obtaining
auxiliaries. The mercenaries most easily obtainable
were the Turks. All contending parties in the Balkan
peninsula were ready to accept their aid. The excuses of
Cantacuzenus are evidence which proves that he realised
the danger of their obtaining a permanent foothold in
Europe. A more valid justification is furnished by the
fact that, with the object of preventing them crossing into
Thrace without his permission, he endeavoured to close the
two passages which they had been accustomed before his
time to employ&mdash;namely, from Lampsacus and between
Sestos and Abydos.</p>

<p>When his own conduct during the time of their joint
emperorship is compared with that of John it is seen that in
love of country, in devotion to its interests, as well as in
sagacity, he is greatly his superior. The difficulties that
arose between them were in fact largely due to the jealousy,
weakness, debauchery, and incompetence of John. When a
youth he was simply a drunken reprobate. That a young
emperor, who believed that he had been supplanted by
another in his right to the sole occupancy of the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
should resent references to his profligacy and his irregular
life was natural enough, but Cantacuzenus cannot justly be
blamed because he refused to surrender the government into
his hands.</p>

<p>Our estimate of the character of Cantacuzenus has to be
based mainly on his own writings. But through them we
know the man better perhaps than any other emperor.
When dealing with events illustrating his own motives and
conduct, he is an unconscious hypocrite. He gives us his
version of all the principal events of his reign. His despatches
and his speeches are reported at weary length, but they
usually leave the impression of having been revised and
modified by the light of his subsequent experience. His
own narrative is confirmed to a considerable extent by that
of Ducas, who, however, is open to suspicion as a partisan.
His grandfather had belonged to the party of Cantacuzenus
and had escaped into Asia Minor to avoid the vengeance of
Apocaukus. Ducas describes Cantacuzenus as distinguished
by the soundness of his judgment and by his great courage.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Cantacuzenus is great in accounting for his failures.
Judged by his own narrative, which may be described as an
<i>apologia pro vita sua</i>, he appears a respectable ecclesiastically
minded man of mediocre talent, seriously desirous of the good
of the people whom he governed, but anxious, above all, not
only to become emperor but to found an imperial family.</p>

<p>The vanity of Cantacuzenus leads him seldom to lose an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>occasion of reporting what friends or enemies say in his
favour. When he sent the embassy to Pope Clement the Sixth
to explain why he had employed Turks and to propose to
render aid to the sovereigns of the West in the expedition
which Clement contemplated, he remarks that the pontiff
spoke in the highest terms of his moderation and kindness
in not having treated his ungrateful enemies with more
severity.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> In his many negotiations with Rome he never
fails to report expressions complimentary to his own
sagacity, character, and conduct. In like manner he records
the flattering expressions used regarding him by the Ottoman
sultan, expressions which then, as now, are nearly destitute
of all meaning, as if they were a serious representation of the
sentiments of the writer. He cannot resist pointing out
that Nicephorus Gregoras, whose History he declares to be
false and malicious, had at one time awarded him unbounded
praise.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>When the chief of the Genoese forces which had captured
Heraclia and were flushed with victory proposed to attack
the capital, Cantacuzenus makes him abandon his design
because he knew that it was defended by the emperor, who
was the equal in wisdom and experience of any commander
of the age.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> It is in the same spirit of self-laudation that
he declares that in the struggle with the Serbians before
Salonica he had exterminated some by the simple terror of
his name and others by his army.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reign of
John after
retirement
of Cantacuzenus
(1355 to
1391).</div>

<p class="tb">John occupied the throne after the retirement of Cantacuzenus
for upwards of thirty-five years. A youth largely
spent in selfish pleasures gave little promise that the young
man of twenty-three would be able to cope with the difficulties
by which the empire was beset. With the aid of his
mother, Anne of Savoy, and of partisans whose only hope was
in the patronage of the new ruler, he had succeeded in
ridding himself of his elderly, respectable, and patriotic
colleague. He had now to face the difficulties with which
the empire was beset. Of these the dynastic struggle which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>still continued with Matthew, the son of Cantacuzenus, was
soon disposed of. An agreement had been arrived at before
the withdrawal of his father by which Matthew should
retain the title of emperor and remain in possession of
certain districts of the Rhodope mountains, and of the
island of Lemnos. A few months later the island was
exchanged for a lordship in the Morea. Shortly afterwards
Matthew was made prisoner by the Serbians, delivered to
John, and, after he had been kept for a while prisoner in
Tenedos, abdicated and retired in 1358 to the Morea.</p>

<p>John had no liking for religious controversies within his
own Church, and although Cantacuzenus in his retirement
wished that the most important of them should be continued
John forbade it. There was a curious theological controversy,
related by the writers of the time, which is of value as
showing that in the midst of the most grave political difficulties
the Byzantine people had not yet lost their interest
in religious questions. Barlaam, a Calabrian abbot of the
Greek Church&mdash;who, as we have seen, had been sent to Rome
to negotiate for Union and aid because, among other reasons,
he was well acquainted with Latin, ‘better indeed than
with Greek’<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>&mdash;charged certain monks at Mount Athos and
their followers, known as Bogomils, with heresy, called them
Omphalopsychae, Messalians, men who believed that by
looking long at their navel they could see God with mortal
eyes,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> or at least with the uncreated light of Mount Tabor.
Barlaam’s great opponent was Palamas, archbishop of
Salonica. The party headed by Palamas was favoured by
Cantacuzenus, whose mother, indeed, was a Bogomil. The
controversy waxed fierce and bitter, but Barlaam was unable
to obtain the condemnation he desired. It raged for fifteen
years until forcibly put an end to by John on the withdrawal
of his colleague.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>By far the most important difficulty which John had to
face was the constantly increasing encroachments by the
Turks. Their influence at the beginning of his sole
occupancy of the throne is shown by the consent he was
forced to give to the engagement of his infant daughter to
the son of Orchan, the great Turkish leader and successor
of Othman. Their influence at a later period, in 1374, is
shown by his having been forced into an alliance with Murad
and, towards the end of his reign, by his having to destroy a
part of the walls of the capital at Murad’s bidding.</p>

<p>At no period of his life did the emperor show that he
possessed ability above the average. Neither he nor any of
his ministers rose above mediocrity. He nevertheless
recognised the danger to his empire from the advance of the
Mahometans, the powerlessness of his own unaided subjects
to resist that advance, and the expediency of obtaining help
from the West. In dealing with some of the questions
which disturbed his subjects he possessed a certain aloofness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>which made him examine them as a statesman. It is
probably true, as Gibbon suggests,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> that in his appeals to
Rome he was greatly influenced by his mother, Anne of
Savoy. She had been brought up as a member of the Latin
Church and, though compelled on her marriage to change
her name and her religion, she yet remained attached to the
Church and country of her childhood. Her struggles during
the minority of her son had not tended to make her look
with favour on the Orthodox, and her influence upon her
son’s mind was probably sufficient to make him regard with
as much favour the Church to which his mother had
belonged as that of which he was now the temporal head.
He had come to regard the differences between the two
Churches as matters rather for ecclesiastics than for statesmen.
He personally was ready to accept the Union of the
Churches and even papal supremacy in religious matters,
provided that in return he could obtain aid from the West
against the enemies of the empire. But, whatever were his
own sentiments towards the Church of Rome, his conduct
during the long period of thirty-five years showed that he
felt the need of external aid if the empire were to be saved.
His reign is one long series of efforts to obtain it. He was
ready to humiliate himself, to use all his powers of persuasion
for Union, provided that the pontiffs would induce Western
rulers to fight the Turks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewed
efforts
by popes
against
Moslems.</div>

<p>Hope was probably stimulated in the empire by the fact
that the pope and the West generally seemed at last to
recognise that, in their own interest, measures should be
taken to defend the empire. Moreover, the danger was now
so pressing, not only to the Greeks but to Europe, that it
appeared possible to obtain aid without submitting to the
humiliating conditions hitherto imposed. While John knew
that to persuade the Orthodox Church to acknowledge any
of its doctrines as heretical, and especially to induce the
ecclesiastics to accept the supremacy of the pope, was
almost impossible, he professed himself ready to make his
own submission. The Union of the Churches could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>accomplished at a later day. There appeared reason to hope
that the pope regarded the danger from the Moslems mainly
from the statesman’s point of view and desired mutual
action. John was so far justified in this hope that it may
be confidently asserted that had the counsels of more than one
of the popes during his reign been followed there would have
been a concerted action against the common enemy sufficient
to have delayed the Turkish progress, and possibly to have
altogether arrested it. We shall see, however, that, although
all the states of Western Europe still acknowledged the
supremacy of the pope, their interests and jealousies were
as diverse as they have been in modern times, and that the
pontiff was able neither to induce nor to compel the nations
acknowledging his supremacy to act in concert.</p>

<p>Knowing from his own visit to Italy and from the
negotiations carried on by Cantacuzenus that Rome was
predisposed to aid, John, immediately he became sole
ruler, sent an embassy to the pope. His delegates were
authorised to make the emperor’s submission to the papal
authority in exchange for the undertaking by the pope to
furnish galleys against the Turks.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1356, John sent a golden bull to
the pope at Avignon containing the terms of his submission.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
The pope thereupon expressed his satisfaction by a reply to
the emperor, and while communicating the good news to
the knights of Rhodes, the king of Cyprus, and the doge of
Venice, invited them to make preparations to aid the Christian
cause. So far, however, as the empire was concerned,
the series of efforts made at the pope’s instigation were
without any satisfactory result. Ill planned, inadequately supported,
unenergetically pursued, they were all almost useless.
Six years afterwards&mdash;namely, in 1362&mdash;John was invited to
join the kings of France and Denmark and Guy de Lusignan
of Cyprus in a Crusade against the Saracens, an expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>of quite secondary importance to the empire. To the men
of the West, Turks and Saracens were all the same. The
Greeks knew better. Two years passed and a new pope, Urban
the Fifth, was still organising a plan against the Saracens.
In reply to the pontiff’s invitation John promised all the aid
possible to the new Crusade, though pointing out that the
benefit to the empire would be slight. But the sovereigns
of the West had had enough of Crusades and would not
respond to the call from Avignon. The companies of military
monks who were in France equally refused to take part
in the proposed undertaking, and the efforts of the pope only
succeeded in inducing a few English adventurers to join with
Peter of Lusignan in a fruitless attack upon Egypt.</p>

<p>At length, in 1366, a more hopeful Crusade, or at least
one more likely to result in advantage to the empire, was
proclaimed. At the bidding of the pope, Louis, king of
Hungary, and Amadeo of Savoy proposed to attack the
Turks and to aid the emperor. Once more the condition
was attached that John should complete the Union of the
Churches. But, once again, the crusading army was
weakened by the division of forces judged necessary for an
attempt at the same time upon the Saracens. Nor would
other states join. In vain the pope threatened the Genoese,
Venetians, and Spaniards with all the terrors of an interdict
if they gave aid to the enemy. They continued to trade
with the Saracens as before. In vain he exhorted the
sovereigns of Western Europe to go to the aid of Cyprus
and Rhodes, and promised them indulgences if they would
take part in this war of the Cross. They turned deaf ears
to his summons.</p>

<p>In 1367 Urban had entered Rome, and one of his first
acts on taking possession of the chair of St. Peter was to
exhort the Genoese and Venetians to facilitate the voyage of
John to the imperial city. The emperor was willing enough
to go to Rome, provided that there was a reasonable chance
of obtaining substantial aid. He had made submission once
and was ready to do all that he could to complete the Union
the pope so greatly desired, but he knew much better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the pope how difficult it would be to induce his people to
accomplish the proposed task. His needs, however, were
great, and the summons of the pope was urgent. Accordingly,
in 1369, he ventured on the dangerous step of leaving
Constantinople. He was received with every honour in the
elder Rome, and made a profession of faith which satisfied
the four cardinals who had been deputed to receive it. An
encyclical notified the great news to all Christian princes.
The pope allowed John to negotiate with English mercenaries
then in Italy for service, granted him religious
privileges, loaded him with presents, and requested the
rulers of the states through which he had to pass on his
homeward journey to receive him with the respect due to
his rank. Urban at the same time addressed a letter to the
Greek clergy urging them to accept the Union.</p>

<p>John, however, found little or no material help. He left
Rome in debt, and on his return to Venice, where, on his
Romeward journey, he had been received in great state and
promised four galleys, he was detained until he paid his
debts. The emperor urged his son Andronicus, who had been
appointed regent during the absence of his father, to find the
means of releasing him. The son declared that as the treasury
was empty and the clergy would not help, he was unable
to obtain ransom. His younger son, Manuel, contrived,
however, to find in Salonica sufficient money for his father’s
release.</p>

<p>Both Urban and his successor, Gregory the Eleventh,
displayed a great desire to aid the empire to stem the tide
of Moslem progress. Gregory in 1371 urged the kings of
France and England to join with the Genoese to save the
remnant of Christians in the Holy Land from the Saracens.
All their efforts were fruitless.</p>

<p>The Turkish invasion had meantime become more
serious than the Saracenic conquests, as the invaders had
now penetrated by land and sea respectively as far as
Albania and Dalmatia. The pope once more urged Louis
of Hungary, the successors of the crusading nobles who still
held territory in Greece and along a portion of the coast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the Adriatic, the knights of Rhodes, and the king of Sicily to
combine in a great movement with John against the common
enemy. Once more he caused a new Crusade to be
preached and promised indulgences to those who took up
the Cross. He begged the Emperor Charles to make peace
with Bavaria so that the empire in the West might join the
Crusade. On all sides, however, there was a reluctance to
enter upon it. In spite of the pope’s influence and promise
to arm twelve galleys for despatch against the Turks, John’s
ambassador returned from the West having completely failed
in obtaining aid.</p>

<p>Gregory the Eleventh was equally persevering in his
efforts to bring about the Union of the Churches. Franciscan
and Dominican missionaries were sent into the East to
expose the wickedness of the schism caused or persisted in
by the Orthodox Church. Nuncios were despatched to complete
the reconciliation. The emperor was reproached,
quite unjustly, because he was unable to persuade or compel
his subjects to accept Union and to become reconciled with
the Latin priests.</p>

<p>The pontiff, however, did not lose sight of his political
object. Louis of Hungary fell under his condemnation
because he had neglected to engage in the Crusade. But
Louis had seen the great defeat of Bulgaria and Southern
Serbia on the Maritza in 1371 and was not prepared to
make war hastily against so formidable a foe as the Turk
had then shown himself to be.</p>

<p>In 1374 the pope returned to the charge and urged the
king of Hungary to be on watch against the incursions
of the Turks into the empire until the fleet prepared at the
pontiff’s expense should arrive in the Marmora. At the
same time he invited John once more to visit Rome in order
to discuss measures for the accomplishment of Union.</p>

<p>In 1375 he again urged Louis of Hungary to do his duty
as chief of the Crusade. He sent five hundred knights of
Rhodes and an equal number of squires to defend the
Greeks. He authorised the bishops in Western lands to
apply large sums from the Church revenues for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
of resisting the enemy of Christendom. His influence fell
far short of his desire. The Hungarian king was reported
to have misappropriated the money he had been allowed to
acquire from the Church, and the great fleet which the
Genoese had collected for the purpose of attacking the
Turks endeavoured to depose John in favour of his son
Andronicus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties
with
Sultan
Murad.</div>

<p>John himself was in serious difficulties with the Ottoman
sultan, Murad. These two sovereigns were now, indeed,
the two great actors on the stage during several years, but
the character of Murad dominated over that of the commonplace
John. To avoid possible treachery, the Christian
emperor, who was not trusted by Murad, was in 1374
compelled with his son Manuel to follow the sultan in a
campaign. During his absence he entrusted the government
to Andronicus, his eldest son. Thereupon an accident
occurred which seems greatly to have impressed contemporaries.
Andronicus entered into an arrangement with
the son of Murad by which the two swore to be friends and
to act together, when one should become emperor and the
other sultan. A definite arrangement may well be doubted
and possibly all that passed was due to the impulsiveness of
boyish friendship without any likelihood of practical result.
Murad, however, when he heard of the agreement, blinded his
son, insisted that John should treat Andronicus in the same
manner, and threatened war if he did not comply. According
to Ducas, John blinded not only Andronicus, but also his infant
son.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Probably the sight of one eye only was destroyed.
Andronicus was imprisoned in the Tower of Anemas with his
wife and son, and John’s younger son, Manuel, was crowned as
co-emperor. Two years afterwards Andronicus escaped to the
Genoese in Galata. With their aid he succeeded in entering
Constantinople, proclaimed himself emperor, and shut up
his father in the same prison in which he had himself been
confined. Two years afterwards the prisoner escaped to
Scutari, and Andronicus had the sense to avoid civil war by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>coming to an arrangement with his father by which John
was once more placed on the throne with his son Manuel.
Andronicus in compensation received certain of the towns
on the north side of the shore of the Marmora.</p>

<p>When Andronicus had succeeded in obtaining possession
of the city with the aid of the Genoese, almost his first act
was to arrest all the Venetians, with whom the Genoese were
again at war. With their aid, John endeavoured to take
Tenedos from his enemies, but failed. In the following year
(1379) the Genoese united themselves with Louis of
Hungary and defeated the Venetians at sea. They were
still sufficiently influential in 1382 to compel the emperor
to make peace with Andronicus.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Constantly strengthening
themselves, they entered into a treaty in 1387 with the
Bulgarian prince of the Dobrutcha.</p>

<p>During this time the Turks were making steady and
almost unchecked progress in Greece, on the eastern shore
of the Aegean, and in Bulgaria and Macedonia. The
inhabitants were becoming weary of the constant struggle
and it is significant that in 1385 the patriarch Nilos wrote
to pope Urban the Sixth that the Turks left complete liberty
to the Church. Even Rome appears to have been in despair.
Urban the Sixth like his predecessors had so completely
made his action against the Turks conditional upon the
renunciation by the Greeks of their heresies and upon
Union with Rome that all hope of aid from him or from
Western Europe had for a time died out.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>The last years of the reign of John Palaeologus were
once more disturbed by domestic troubles. His eldest son,
Andronicus, had died in 1385, but his grandson, John, had
many friends and was supported by the Genoese. His party
was sufficiently powerful to gain an entry into the city by
the Chariseus or Adrianople Gate and to compel the old
Emperor John to associate his grandson of the same name
as emperor with Manuel, his younger son, and himself.
After a few months, however, Manuel, who had never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>accepted the arrangement, entered by the Golden Gate and
<span class="sidenote">Death of
John.</span>his nephew fled. In 1391, the elder Emperor John died
after a reign of fifty-one years.</p>

<p>During his long occupancy of the throne the power of the
Turks had enormously increased and the empire had almost
become a vassal of Murad. In the last year of his reign
there occurred an incident, already alluded to, which illustrates
at once the weakness of John and his practical vassalage to
the Turks. Wishing to strengthen the landward walls and
especially at and near the Golden Gate, where the defences
had fallen into decay, he gave out that he was about to clear
the city of its accumulated rubbish and to ornament that gate.
Bajazed, who was now the Ottoman sultan and successor of
his father, Murad, when he learned what had been done,
insisted that the new defensive works should be destroyed,
threatening that if his wishes were not complied with
he would put out the eyes of John’s son Manuel, who
had gone by the Sultan’s orders to accompany the Turkish
army on a campaign in Pamphylia. John obeyed the orders
he had received.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> death of John, in 1391, is a convenient period to resume
the narrative of the progress of the Turks.</p>

<p>Othman had died the year after the capture of Brousa,
in 1326. He had succeeded in making his division of the
Turks the most formidable in Asia Minor, in conquering or
absorbing the Seljukian Turks, in destroying many flourishing
cities and strongholds on the Black Sea, in entirely
preventing the reorganisation of the power of the empire in
the north-west portion of Asia Minor, and, above all, in
organising a fighting race into a formidable army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reign of
Sultan
Orchan,
1326–1357.</div>

<p>His successor was his son Orchan. Nicaea is only
distant four or five hours from Brousa, and had hitherto
been able to resist all attacks by the Turks. Its population
was fairly secure within its extensive and strong walls; the
beautiful lake of Ascanius adjoins one side of it, and furnished
a constant supply of water and of fish. Once, indeed,
an emperor had sent up a fleet to assist a great army of
Western Crusaders, and to receive from their hands the city
which they were about to capture from the Seljuks.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Orchan
laid siege to it, and its citizens defended themselves with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>courage until relief came. Cantacuzenus and his sovereign
hastily gathered together an army, and acting upon the
advice of the imperial Grand Huntsman Godfrey, the bearer
of the illustrious name which had won its first renown in
the Crusade before this very place, successfully drove back
the Turks. Unfortunately, on the evening of the same day,
a panic seized the imperial troops, and the enemy, taking
advantage of it, struck hard, captured the baggage, changed
the panic into a rout, and captured the great and important
city in the very hour of its triumph.</p>

<p>Master of the two cities, Brousa, a natural stronghold
which had been strengthened by successive emperors, and
Nicaea, whose ancient reputation and importance as the
City of the Creed had been increased by its having served
during two generations as the rallying place of the exiles
from Constantinople during the Latin occupation, Orchan
now assumed the title of sultan, made Brousa his capital,
and struck the first Ottoman coins to replace those of the
Seljukian sultans.</p>

<p>During his reign of thirty-two years he enlarged the
territory occupied by the Ottomans, and greatly improved
their national organisation. While constantly engaged in
war, and though not less bent on conquest than his father,
he neglected no opportunity of inducing the Christian
subjects of the empire to come under his rule. He took
care that the taxes levied were less than those paid in the
empire. Although by this time Turkish armies were probably
almost exclusively Moslem, Orchan formed one of his
best regiments out of Christians who had voluntarily
entered his service.</p>

<p>Orchan was far from obtaining uniform successes against
the empire. He was often and bravely opposed by the
imperial troops. In 1329, a large army, which had been
transported into Thrace in a fleet of seventy ships, was destroyed
near Trajanopolis, and most of the Turks were either
killed or reduced to slavery. In 1330, a new invasion into
Thrace of Turkish cavalry was defeated, and fifteen thousand
Turks were slain. Orchan’s attempt in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
year to capture Ismidt failed, and he was obliged to sue
for peace. In spite of these disasters, he was always able
within a few months to assemble new armies, and to renew
the struggle. Already he had succeeded in exacting tribute
from nearly the whole of Bithynia. His troops, within two
years, invaded Macedonia, Euboea, and Athens, and while
Cantacuzenus was with difficulty holding his own against
them, another army met Andronicus the Third in Thrace,
and took possession of Rodosto&mdash;an army, however, which
the emperor shortly afterwards destroyed.</p>

<p>New recruits were continually making their way across
the Dardanelles or the Marmora into Thrace, until, in 1336,
the Turkish army in that province met with disaster in an
unexpected manner. A band of Tartars from the north
made a descent upon them when they heard that they had
been successful in a raid upon the Christian population and
were carrying off an enormous mass of booty.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> Three
months after the departure of the Tartars a new descent
into Thrace was attempted by the Turks. Once again the
Greeks were successful, and, in the same year, an army which
ravaged the environs of Constantinople was destroyed and
the Turkish fleet which brought them captured.</p>

<p>The efforts of Orchan were more successful in Asia
Minor. A division of his army had laid siege again to
Ismidt, and the inhabitants, in order to avoid imminent
<span class="sidenote">Nicomedia
taken
(1337).</span>starvation, surrendered. The acquisition, in 1337, of this
city, the most important seaport on the Asiatic side of the
Marmora, and the head, then as now, of all the roads
leading from the capital to every part of Asia Minor, Persia,
and Syria, was of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>During the stormy joint reigns of John and Cantacuzenus
(1342 to 1355), the empire was attacked both by Tartars on
the north, and by the Turks in Asia Minor. The Bulgarian
and Serbian kingdoms had both gained strength during the
Latin occupation at the expense of the empire, and were ready
to avail themselves of the aid alike of Turks and Tartars in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>their endeavours to capture territory from the empire.
When, in 1342, Cantacuzenus was attacked by the Bulgarians,
a division of the Turks, whose emir had taken the title of
sultan of Lydia, was induced to come to his aid. Twenty-nine
thousand arrived at the mouth of the Maritza, the
ancient Hebrus, and with their aid a temporary relief was
afforded; but for some reason, possibly a severe winter, they
withdrew to Asia Minor. The Bulgarians on this occasion
were not aided by the Tartars, probably because the latter
were occupied in the Crimea, and throughout what is now
southern Russia, in fighting the Genoese, who had blockaded
the northern coast of the Black Sea. Apocaukus, the rival
of Cantacuzenus, succeeded in the following year in hiring
a Turkish fleet and army. Both sides, indeed, in the civil
war then going on, as well as the Bulgarians and Serbians,
never hesitated to increase their armies by employing Turks
or Tartars as auxiliaries.</p>

<p>When, in 1344, Cantacuzenus promised his daughter
Theodora in marriage to Orchan, he received at once the aid
of a body of five thousand Ottoman Turks, and this number
was increased when the marriage took place, two years later.
But the young emperor John met him with another body of
Turkish auxiliaries. Orchan would have made short work
of John; for in an interview which took place with much
ceremony and cordiality at Scutari to congratulate his
father-in-law on his second coronation, he appears to have
decided upon following the Turkish method of getting rid of
a rival to the throne of his father-in-law. Cantacuzenus,
however, would not sanction assassination. Orchan apparently
could not understand any such scruples, and shortly
afterwards sent a number of Turks to the capital on a
pretended political mission, but really with the object of
aiding Cantacuzenus by murdering John. The elder emperor,
as soon as he learned the design, at once put his
foot down, and declared that he would not permit John to
go outside the palace except accompanied by him.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>In the attacks by Stephen, the kral of Serbia, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>taken the title of emperor of the Serbians and the Greeks,
or emperor of Serbia and Romania&mdash;for both forms are
used&mdash;Orchan once more sent troops to aid his father-in-law.
In the struggles which took place at this time between the
Genoese and the Venetians, Orchan aided the first. When
the emperor wished to employ both, he was obliged to
concede to the Turks a stronghold on the Thracian Chersonese.
They, however, always proved to be dangerous
allies, and the inhabitants of the whole northern coast of
the Marmora were so harassed by them that great numbers
deserted their farms and fled to the capital or elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was in 1355 that Cantacuzenus left the government in
the hands of John. His policy and his influence had been
directed towards coming to an agreement with the leading
group of Turks&mdash;that, namely, ruled over by his son-in-law.
Almost the last act before his withdrawal was to persuade
Orchan and his son, Suliman, to give up the cities in Thrace
which the Turks had occupied, on his behalf, during the
struggle with John.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Orchan, on his part, was to all
appearances disposed, on the retirement of Cantacuzenus, to
be on friendly terms with John, and, in consequence, each
party assumed the attitude of an ally. It may be suggested
that if a policy of friendliness had been continued, the
Turks might have been content with their territory in Asia
Minor. But such a solution was not possible. The Turkish
nomad warriors, to whom the cultivation of the soil was
distasteful, required new lands to roam over, and wanted
new territories to plunder. The arable lands, which had
supported large populations, were too small for nomad
shepherds, and the latter were always being pressed forward
to the north and west by a constant stream of immigrants
behind them. Indeed, in the year when Cantacuzenus
abdicated, Suliman, the son of Orchan, had to lead his
armies and defend his territories against a newly arrived
horde of Tartars in the north-east of Asia Minor. His
successful defence was, at the same time, one more blow
against the empire, for in this campaign he succeeded in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Angora
taken
(1354).</span>capturing the important stronghold of Angora, which commanded
the great highroad to Persia.</p>

<p>But Orchan and John, though nominally on friendly
terms, distrusted each other, and indeed Orchan’s character
and conduct compare favourably with John’s. When
Halil, the son of Orchan and of John’s sister-in-law
Theodora, was captured by pirates from Phocaea, at the
head of the Gulf of Smyrna, and then in the occupation of
the Genoese, it was with difficulty that John could be
induced to join in the siege of that city in order to release
his nephew. He endeavoured to make a bargain with
Orchan before he consented to co-operate. Finally Halil
was ransomed, Orchan and John each paying half of the
amount. On his release the two rulers met, and at Chalcedon,
the present Kadikeuy, John promised his infant
daughter to Halil, and the two rulers swore to establish a
perpetual peace.</p>

<p>In 1359 Orchan died. During the thirty-two years of
his reign, he had planted the Ottoman state firmly in Asia
Minor. The landmarks of its progress were the important
cities of Nicaea, Ismidt, and Angora, each of which dominated
a large tract of country. He had compacted the Turks
together, had attracted to his rule many of those who had
previously acknowledged other emirs, and every year of his
reign had seen the number of Ottoman Turks increasing by
defections from his rivals and by immigrants from the eastward.
He was an able commander and an exceptionally
good administrator. While Othman is the founder of the
Turkish dynasty, Orchan is the sovereign who caused his
people to be recognised as forming a separate nationality,
and was thus the maker of the Turkish nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sultan
Murad the
First,
1359–1389.</div>

<p>Orchan was succeeded by his son Amurath or, adopting
the modern orthography, Murad. He was the younger
brother of Suliman, who died two months before his father.
The new sultan was not influenced by any tie of relationship
with the imperial family. Moreover, the influence of Islam
was now becoming much more serious than it had hitherto
been. Mahometanism had become the religion of most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the Turks, and Murad, stimulated by a certain mufti, soon
learned to become a fanatical persecutor of even his own
Christian subjects. He increased the amount of taxes
which they had to pay, and generally made their burdens
heavy. But by far the heaviest of those burdens was
caused by the organisation of the body of ‘New Troops’
established by Orchan and known as Janissaries. He
decreed a law, said to be founded upon the sacred text of
the Koran, that the Christians should be required to give to
himself absolutely one in five of their children. From the
boys thus obtained, he established the famous corps whose
deeds were to make them for ever famous.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>At the commencement of his reign, Murad turned to
conquest. The work of Orchan had been to establish and
compact Ottoman rule in Asia Minor. That of his successor
was mainly to carry out a similar policy in Europe. After
capturing Heraclia on the Black Sea, he crossed over into
Thrace and occupied Adrianople, seized Didymotica and
Chorlou, overran the whole country between Constantinople
and Bulgaria, and sent his ships to plunder the Greek
islands. In return for the fanaticism with which they had
inspired him, he promised that one fifth of the spoil captured
by land and sea should be given to the mollahs. When the
sale of Christian captives took place, he took care, says
Ducas,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> that the young, the well set-up, and the strong men
should be bought at a low price to be added to the Janissaries.</p>

<p>The few remaining Turkish emirs in Asia Minor whose
territories had not been gained by the Ottomans joined
forces to resist the new sultan. At the same time the
Serbians, Bulgarians, and Hungarians, all of whom had
become alarmed at Murad’s progress, declared war upon
him. Compelled in 1363 to defend himself against the
emirs to the east and south of his territories in Asia
Minor, he was sufficiently strong to force the emperor to
bind himself not merely to give aid to him in Asia but not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>to attempt to recover any of the cities or territories which
he had conquered in Europe. When he had broken the
strength of the rebel emirs he crossed rapidly back into
Thrace and near Adrianople defeated a combined army of
Hungarians, Serbians, and Bulgarians. Two years afterwards,
in 1366, an army of fifty thousand Serbians
endeavoured in vain to drive Murad out of Adrianople. The
lowest degradation which the empire had yet reached was
when the miserable John consented to become the tributary of
Murad in order that he might enjoy his remaining possessions
in Europe. In 1373 he formally recognised the sultan
as his suzerain, bound himself to render him military service
and to give his son Manuel as a hostage.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>The only palliative which can be offered for John’s conduct
is that he felt resistance to be useless. The empire
wanted peace. The cities and towns had been devastated,
not merely by successive wars, civil and foreign, but by the
terrible Black Death, a plague which since 1346 had
demanded everywhere its large quota of victims. He had
seen Turkish armies defeated, but everywhere and always
reappearing in greater numbers than ever. Asiatics were in
overwhelming numbers on every side. The Egyptian
Moslems had captured Sis, the capital of the Lesser Armenia,
in 1369. Not only was every district in Asia Minor overrun
with Turks, but they had penetrated Europe at many
points. Bands of them had been left in the country when
the armies, invited into Macedonia or Thrace or crossing
over for plunder, had withdrawn. ‘For my part, I believe,’
says Ducas, ‘that there is a greater multitude of them
between the Dardanelles and the Danube than in Asia
Minor,’ and although Ducas wrote three quarters of a century
later, his remarks are applicable to the reign of John. He
describes how Turks from Cappadocia, Lycia, Cilicia, and
Caria had sailed into Europe to pillage and to ruin the lands
of the Christians. A hundred thousand had laid waste the
country as far west as Dalmatia. The Albanians from
being a large nation had become a small one. The Wallachs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>the Serbians, and his own people, the Romans, had been
completely ruined. Amid his lamentations over the evils
inflicted by the invaders, his saddest thought and gravest
source of complaint is that the victories gained by the Turks
had been won by men who were the offspring of Christian
parents, by Janissaries who were of Roman, Bulgarian,
Serbian, Wallachian, or Hungarian origin. It is in the
hopelessness of further resistance to such overwhelming
forces that the only explanation of John’s acceptance of the
position of a tributary prince is to be found.</p>

<p>The ruin of the South Serbians and Eastern Bulgarians
of which Ducas speaks had really taken place. They had
each ventured to declare themselves empires. With the
indifference which characterises the Greek writers in regard
to the conduct of other nations, they allude to rather than
<span class="sidenote">Battle of
Harmanli,
1371.</span>mention how that ruin had been brought about. In 1371, a
great battle took place on the plains of the river Maritza
which sealed the fate of the Eastern Bulgarians and of the
Serbians who were in Macedonia. The three sons of the
kral took advantage of the absence of Murad in Asia and,
having collected an army of sixty thousand men, marched
almost as far as Adrianople without opposition. While
they were feasting in front of a bridge over the Maritza near
Harmanli, fully assured of their safety by reason of their
superiority in numbers, suddenly a night attack was made
upon them by a small division of the Turkish army. It
was soon joined by the entire army of seventy thousand
Turks. Wild confusion was followed by a terrible slaughter.
One of the three sons of the kral was killed and the other
two were drowned in the Maritza. Hundreds of soldiers
perished in attempting to cross it. The army was simply
annihilated.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>To assist him in his conquest of Hungary, Serbia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>Bulgaria, and Moldavia, Murad allied himself, in 1373, with
the Tartars north of the Danube, and both prepared to
attack these states.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the troubles which arose in 1374 between
John and his son Manuel on the one side and Andronicus
the grandson of John by his eldest son of the same name,
Murad exercised his right as suzerain. Shortly after Manuel
was associated with his father, the two were ordered to
accompany their lord on an expedition. It was during their
absence that the eldest sons of the emperor and sultan, as
already mentioned, either swore friendship and common
action, when each succeeded to his father’s throne, or were
considered by their fathers to have done so. It may have
been believed that they had entered into a conspiracy to
hasten such succession. Countouz, the obnoxious son of
Murad, raised a rebellion against his father when he heard
of his cruel resolve, but his troops passed over to the side of
their sultan. He fled to Didymotica and joined Andronicus,
who was also a fugitive from his father. Murad followed
his son, and laid siege to that city. The inhabitants, pressed
by famine, opened the gates to him. Countouz was blinded
by his father, but Andronicus escaped; all the garrison was
drowned and a large number of the inhabitants had their
throats cut, Murad adding to his barbarity by compelling
the fathers to be the executioners of their sons.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>In 1379, as already mentioned, John and his son Manuel,
who had been captured and imprisoned by his grandson
Andronicus, escaped to Scutari and took refuge with Bajazed,
the son of Murad. The sultan, after assuring himself that
the inhabitants of Constantinople preferred Manuel to Andronicus,
made a bargain with John and his son by which, in
return for aid in restoring them, the empire should pay a large
annual tribute, furnish a contingent of twelve thousand soldiers,
and surrender to him Philadelphia, the last remaining city
in Asia Minor which still acknowledged the rule of Constantinople.
John and Manuel entered Constantinople by the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>Adrianople Gate, and Andronicus escaped across the Golden
Horn to the Genoese in Galata. Much as the two emperors
may have regretted their bargain, Murad held them to it,
<span class="sidenote">Philadelphia
surrendered,
1379.</span>
and they, Christian emperors, marched to Philadelphia, in
order to compel their own subjects to open its gates to the
Turks.</p>

<p>Everywhere the Moslem flood was becoming irresistible.
The sultan of Bagdad, in 1376, invaded Armenia and took
prisoners both its king and queen; at the other extreme of
the empire the Turks were in Epirus and were holding their
own in many parts of Morea. The Knights-Hospitallers
surrendered Patras to them in order to purchase the release
of their Grand Master. One of the few strongholds in
Thrace which Murad had not hitherto obtained was Apollonia,
the present Sissipoli, which, partly built on an island
in the Black Sea and in an otherwise strong position, had so
far avoided capture. It was taken, however, by Murad in
1383, and, as usual, its garrison was cruelly massacred. In
1385, Murad captured Sofia, and then sent two armies, one
to take possession of Cavalla and other places on the north
shore of the Aegean, and the other to capture Monastir and
various towns in Macedonia. In the same year a Turkish
army took Belgrade and pushed on to Scutari in Albania,
taking possession of it and of other strongholds. In 1387,
after a siege lasting four years, Salonica was captured.</p>

<p>The Serbians, by their defeat at Belgrade and elsewhere,
were compelled to become the vassals of Murad, and, following
his usual custom, the sultan compelled their kral in
1381 to send two thousand men to aid him in subduing a
revolt of his brother-in-law, the emir, in Caramania, the
ancient Cilicia. Many subjects of the empire had to render
like military service.</p>

<p>On the return of the Serbians, their discontent was so
great that the kral Lazarus, son of the famous Stephen,
collected a large army and made an effort for freedom. But,
though his armies succeeded in killing twenty thousand of
the enemy, Ali Pasha compelled them again to submit to the
Turkish yoke. The brave Serbians soon, however, recovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">First battle
of Cossovo-pol,
1889.</span>and Lazarus succeeded in making alliances with his Christian
neighbours which promised success. In 1389, with a large
army of his own subjects, of Hungarians, Wallachs, Dalmatians,
and Albanians, he once more endeavoured to crush
the common enemy. A decisive battle was fought on the
Plain of Black Birds or Cossovo-pol, in what is now called
Old Serbia.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> Murad and his son Bajazed were in command.
The Christians broke the right wing of the Turks, but the
issue of the battle was turned by the daring of Bajazed.
Lazarus and his suite were taken prisoners, and the triumph
of the enemy was complete. The latest historian of Serbia
observes that as the battle on the Maritza in 1371 sealed
the fate of the Eastern Bulgarians and of the Serbians in
Macedonia, so did this battle of Cossovo-pol in 1389 determine
that of the Northern Serbians and the Western
Bulgarians.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Assassination
of
Murad.</div>

<p>During or immediately after the battle, there followed a
dramatic incident. A young Serb ran towards the Turkish
army, and when they would have stopped him declared that
he wanted to see their sultan in order that he might show
him how he could profit by the fight. Murad signed to him
to come near, and the young fellow did so, drew a dagger
which he had hidden, and plunged it into the heart of the
sultan. He was at once cut down by the guards.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> The
Serbians, according to Ducas, did not know of the sultan’s
death for a considerable time, and did not defend themselves
with their usual courage. Lazarus was captured, and was
hewn in pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manuel</span> was with the Turkish army at Brousa when he
learned the death of his father in 1391. He escaped secretly,
hastened to Constantinople, and succeeded in being proclaimed
as the sole occupant of the imperial throne.
Bajazed, who had become sultan on the assassination of his
father, Murad, in 1389, taken by surprise at the escape of his
hostage, at once presented alarming demands. He asked
that the Turks should have a resident cadi within Constantinople
itself and that Manuel should declare himself to be
the sultan’s vassal and pay tribute. After a year of fruitless
negotiations, which Manuel had protracted in order that he
might send to the West to implore aid, Bajazed attacked the
empire on every side. Within a few months Turks were
pillaging the Adriatic coast, were exterminating or carrying
off prisoners from Thrace, and were laying siege to the
capital. Their leader before the city urged the citizens to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
declare for Manuel’s nephew, John, the son of Andronicus,
who had, indeed, been compelled by Bajazed to come forward
as a pretender. In 1395 John joined the Turks in attacking
the capital, but was defeated. The Turkish leader returned
across the Bosporus, strengthened his position on the
Gulf of Ismidt, by building a castle or fortress, probably the
one now seen at Guebseh, and another on the Bosporus
known as Guzel-hissar,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> and then once more summoned
Manuel to surrender the city. Thereupon the emperor took
a step which, if the version of Ducas is correct, justifies his
historian for attributing it to wisdom and patriotism. He
arranged to share the empire with John, to leave the city
himself, and to allow him to enter on condition that he
would not hand it over to the Turks. John, however, on
his side had agreed with Bajazed that Selymbria and the
other places on the north shore of the Marmora which he
had held since the death of his father should be delivered to
the Turks, and, this arrangement being concluded, the city
was saved from attack.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>Meantime the spread of the Turks over new territories
once more alarmed the West, and in 1394 Boniface preached
a Crusade and urged in what is now Austria and the states of
Venice that immediate action should be taken against them.
The danger was pressing and the pope’s call to battle was
this time responded to. Sigismund, the Hungarian king,
informed the emperor that he had fifty-two thousand armed
men, and invited his co-operation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Nicopolis,
1396.</div>

<p>But the men of the West had not yet learned how
formidable the Turks could be. In 1396 at Nicopolis on
the Danube the united Christian army was met by Bajazed,
who inflicted upon it a crushing defeat. How that defeat
was accomplished will be told when giving the story
of Bajazed’s life. Bajazed recaptured all the places in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>Hungary which he had previously lost, threatened to
besiege Buda, boasted that he would annex Germany and
Italy and feed his horse with oats on the altar of St. Peter
at Rome. So serious was the disaster of Nicopolis and the
impression it produced that at length the Venetian senate
recognised the necessity of joining their traditional enemies
the Genoese in order to send a powerful fleet against
the common enemy. Boucicaut, a skilful sailor who was
named admiral, took command. He arrived at Gallipoli with
a fleet containing fourteen hundred knights. They met near
the Dardanelles seventeen well-armed Turkish galleys and
defeated them. Shortly afterwards Boucicaut was proclaimed
by Venetians and Genoese admiral-in-chief. He
pushed on to the Bosporus and arrived just in time to
relieve Galata, which was being besieged by the Turks.
Manuel named him Grand Constable. Boucicaut next
endeavoured to recapture Ismidt but without success. Elsewhere,
however, he succeeded in inflicting several losses on
the Turks and especially harassed their settlements on the
eastern shore of the Bosporus. Finding he was powerless
without further aid to inflict serious damage upon them, he
urged Manuel to acknowledge the king of France as his
suzerain, in order that he might receive aid. His project
met with the approval of the Venetians, the Genoese, and of
Manuel himself. Boucicaut returned to France to obtain
assistance and to employ his own influence in favour of the
project, but Charles the Sixth, being unable or unwilling
to protect his proposed vassal, refused to receive his submission.</p>

<p>Manuel, at the end of 1399, decided to follow the example
of his predecessor and to see whether his own efforts would
not be more successful in obtaining aid from the West. He
was received, as they had been, with imperial honours in
Venice and elsewhere, but neither from that city nor from
Florence, Ferrara, Genoa, or Milan did he secure any
assistance. His public entry into Paris was with a display
that was intended more to please the Parisians than to be
of use to him, and he soon learnt that there was as little to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
be hoped from France as from Italy. Nor was he more
successful on his visit to Henry the Fourth in England.
After an absence of two and a half years, Manuel returned to
his capital. He found that the Turks had employed the
time with energy and had made great progress in their raids
on the empire. His own people were almost in despair.
The Turks were once more besieging the capital and were
securely established on the opposite shore of the Bosporus.
The population of Constantinople had decreased. Many of
its buildings had fallen out of repair, and its territory in
Thrace was almost limited by the walls of the city.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he arrived at a moment when if
Christendom had been united a great and possibly a fatal blow
might have been struck against the common enemy. The
lieutenant of Boucicaut was defending Constantinople
against the third attempt by Bajazed to capture the city,
when the tidings from the great Timour or Tamarlane gave
the besieger pause. Bajazed withdrew. Timour, indeed, had
summoned the sultan to give up to the Greeks all territory
that he had taken from them and had asked the Genoese to
co-operate and obtain the co-operation of other Western
powers against the Turks. Bajazed not only refused to obey
the summons but went forward to attack Timour and, as we
shall see when dealing with the life of Bajazed, was in the
great battle of Angora, on July 25, 1402, defeated and made
prisoner. He died in the following year. The defeat of the
sultan gave a new lease of life to the city, but no aid came
from the Christians of the West. The Venetians and Genoese
were again at war with each other and Western Europe was
as divided and as powerless for concerted action against the
Turks as it has so often been since.</p>

<p>The Turks in less than a generation after the withdrawal
of Timour recovered all their influence and territory.
Manuel was compelled even as early as 1403 to recognise
Bajazed’s successor, Suliman (to whom, indeed, he gave his
granddaughter in marriage), as lord of a large portion of
Thrace. Suliman, however, proved himself a weak and
worthless leader of the Turks, and in 1409 the Janissaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
preferring his brother Mousa, arrested and killed him. He
was succeeded by Mahomet, the first of that name in the
Ottoman dynasty, who had been aided by Manuel and who
in return gave back to the emperor the fortified places on
the Marmora and Black Sea which had been in the occupation
of the Turks: an almost solitary instance of this kind of
generosity on the part of the Turks, who hold as a religious
principle that they must only surrender territory to force.
Mahomet had, however, given his promise to Manuel and,
says Ducas, he faithfully kept it.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>During the next few years and until the death of
the sultan, Manuel’s relations with him were friendly. In
1415 the two sovereigns had an interview at Gallipoli.
Although the Turks were pursuing their encroachments in
Hungary and Dalmatia, Mahomet abstained from attacking
the empire. When they carried off nearly two thousand captives
into slavery from Euboea, its Venetian rulers were compelled
to seek the mediation of Manuel in order to obtain peace.
Five years afterwards, Mahomet in passing to his dominions
in Asia Minor went by way of the capital, and Phrantzes
testifies that, in spite of suggestions to seize him, Manuel
refused to violate the right of hospitality. So great was the
sultan’s trust in the emperor that Mahomet named Manuel
as the guardian of his two younger sons.</p>

<p>Murad, the eldest son and successor of Mahomet, who
became sultan in 1420, proposed a renewal of the alliance
with Manuel. The latter would probably have consented.
He was overruled, however, by the senate, which was in
favour of a policy of war and decided that John should
be associated with his father. A demand was made to
Murad to send his two younger brothers to Constantinople,
and the grand vizier returned the answer which might have
been expected, that the education of two Mussulmans could
not be entrusted to the enemies of their faith&mdash;believers
to be educated by infidels.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> War followed, and the Greeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>supported a pretender to the Turkish throne, who was soon
defeated and hanged by Murad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of
Constantinople
by
Murad,
1422.</div>

<p>Thereupon, in 1422, siege was laid to Constantinople.
The walls had largely fallen out of repair and the three
thousand men who were sent as a first detachment sat down
before it in hope of an easy capture. A few days later
Murad himself appeared, bringing with him in chains the
Greek ambassadors who had been sent to treat of peace. A
large army of two hundred thousand men, together with a
great crowd of bashi-bazouks, encamped before the landward
walls and built an earthwork for their protection from the
Golden Gate to the Xyloporta at the end of the walls on the
Golden Horn. Among them, or arriving shortly afterwards,
was a certain Mersaite, a Madhi, a half-mad fanatic at the
head of five hundred dervishes. He claimed to be of the
blood of Mahomet and to possess prophetic powers. He
foretold that the capture of the city would happen when he
gave the signal, for which all were to be ready. The sultan
had sat down before the walls in the middle of June, but his
primitive bombs, his wooden towers, and his attempts to
undermine the walls were of no avail. Mersaite prophesied
a capture on August 24. On that day the defenders of the
foss were rained upon with showers of arrows and a general
assault was made, but the two Theodosian walls, which were
defended by crowds of citizens, were far too strong to be
captured by the simple fanatical onslaught of dervishes.
The Greeks fought valiantly, the young Emperor John being
at their head and on horseback, in the peribolos outside the
Romanus Military Gate, formerly knowm as the Pempton.
Upon the failure of the attack by the dervishes, Murad
suddenly raised the siege and the Greeks pursued the retreating
army and captured some of their rude guns.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> The
immediate cause of the raising of the siege of Constantinople
is variously stated. Manuel had sent aid to the adherents of
Mustafa, the younger brother of Murad, aged only six years,
and had thus strengthened the revolt which had been raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>in his favour in Asia Minor. It was of more importance to
Murad to put an end to this Turkish rising than to persist
in his attempt to capture the city.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death
of Manuel,
1425.</div>

<p>In 1425 Manuel, whom Ducas describes not incorrectly
as a wise and moderate prince, died, after a reign of thirty-four
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John,
1425–1448.</div>

<p>John, sometimes called the Fifth and sometimes the
Seventh of that name, now became sole emperor, and
reigned from 1425 to 1448. The two features of his reign
which make all incidents in it that are not connected with
them of comparative insignificance, are, first, the steady
almost unchecked progress of the Turks in south-eastern
Europe and in Asia Minor: the encroachment of an overwhelming
flood, now apparently receding in one direction,
but again sweeping over every obstacle in another, and in
reality always steadily advancing and submerging all the
Christian populations in the Balkan peninsula: and, second,
the efforts of the emperor and those about him to save the
remnant of the empire by obtaining the help of Europe.</p>

<p>John’s reign was spent in one continuous effort to obtain
assistance from the West to save the city and to check
the progress of the Turks. Like his predecessors, he
addressed himself to successive popes. Perhaps nothing
brings more vividly before the reader of European history
the power of the occupants of the pontifical chair than the
fact that it was taken for granted that from the pope, and
the pope alone, that Western aid could be obtained. We
have seen that former emperors had looked to the kings of
France and England and to other princes, but their aid was
sought only on the advice and with the support of Rome.
In justice also it must be admitted that no princes recognised
so completely as did a long series of popes the expediency and
duty of defending Constantinople as the first outwork of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>defences of Europe against the forces of Asia, and of aiding
its emperors in their efforts to check the Turkish invasion.
They were the prime ministers of Western Europe and
almost the only persons who regarded the Eastern question
as statesmen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while the popes saw the necessity of
preventing the progress of the barbarians, they attached
conditions to their offers of help which made them unacceptable
and which indeed were impossible: namely, that
the Greeks should accept the Union of the Churches, with
which Union was associated the supremacy of the pope.</p>

<p>A succession of pontiffs during the two hundred years
preceding the Moslem conquest of the city worked for
Union with marvellous persistency. The same passionate
desire for reunion is not less manifest now in the occupant
of the chair of St. Peter; but modern efforts are made with
this essential difference, that while in the period which
concerns us it was believed that reunion could be imposed,
every one now recognises that if it is to be brought about,
it must be by voluntary and full consent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Errors in
West regarding
Orthodox
Church.</div>

<p>In the fourteenth century it never seems to have
occurred either to popes or emperors that people cannot be
compelled to change their religious opinions. The idea was
that the great mass of people were ready to accept any
opinion sanctioned by the ordinary civil authorities. The
early negotiations leave the impression that the Churchmen
of the West thought that the emperor and the patriarch
could bring about a Union by their simple decree, could
change the profession of belief and obtain the admission of
papal supremacy without the voluntary consent of even the
Greek ecclesiastics. It never appears to have dawned upon
Roman Churchmen that the members of the Orthodox
Church might refuse to accept Union and a change in belief
when these had been accepted by the civil and religious
chiefs. Such a view showed ignorance at once of the character,
always intensely conservative, and of the history of the
Orthodox Church. Without entering into a discussion of
how far the population of the capital and the empire was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Greek by race, it is sufficient to recall that Greek was the
language of the people, that all that they knew of history
and philosophy, all their methods of thought, their theology
and literature, had come to them in Greek forms. They
thought and spoke as Greeks. Most of them gloried in
being Greek. In matters of philosophic and religious
speculation the Greek mind was more acute, and more
subtle, than the Western mind. In theological questions,
probably all classes were more interested than the corresponding
classes in the West. If in the course of centuries
the common people had ceased to take that keen interest in
matters of theological speculation which caused the artisan
or tradesman to neglect his immediate occupation in order
to ask his customer’s opinion on the merits of the latest
heresy, it was largely because the great formulas of
Christian belief had, as it was believed, received their final
adjustment. If any questions were unsolved&mdash;as, for example,
that of the Inner Light&mdash;the population was always ready to
take an interest in them; but it deeply resented any attempt
to dogmatise without full discussion. It especially resented
the determination of such questions by a foreign authority.
The Greek Churchmen considered themselves, and probably
rightly, as better versed in theology than those of Rome.
They had the tradition of being admittedly superior in
learning to their brethren in the West, and, though ready at
all times to discuss, would not consent to be dictated to by
the bishop of Rome.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church not only made the mistake of disregarding
the traditional susceptibilities of the Eastern people,
who invariably, after 1204, associated the rule of Rome with
the abominations of the Latin occupation; of disregarding
also the universal interest felt in the Orthodox Church on
theological questions, but it greatly underrated the authority
and influence of the Orthodox clergy when such authority
and influence were in conflict with the emperor or even with
the emperor and patriarch combined. Much has been
written of what is called Caesaropapism: that is, of the combination
of the secular and ecclesiastical powers which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
supposed to be vested in the emperors. At various times
the autocrat undoubtedly assumed much of the power which
in the Holy Roman Empire in the West was left to the
popes. At other times, however, and in some matters at all
times, the patriarch of Constantinople exercised a jurisdiction
independent of the emperor. The religious sanctions
possessed by the Church were not to be set aside even by or
for him. We have seen, for example, that when the Emperor
Michael the Eighth had usurped the crown and blinded the
infant John so as to prevent him coming to the throne,
though the ecclesiastics seemed to have considered it expedient
that he should retain the office he had usurped, the
patriarch Arsenius and the prelates associated with him could
not be either coaxed or frightened into granting him absolution,
and that it was not until Arsenius and his successor,
Germanus, had ceased to occupy the patriarchal throne that
the emperor could succeed in having the anathema removed.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Many other examples could be given which show that it
is an error to suppose that the patriarchs were merely or
even usually the creatures of the emperors. When questions
of dogma arose the head of the Orthodox Church supported
by his clergy was jealous of the secular power. The history
of Constantinople during the time between the Latin and
the Moslem conquests of the city abounds in illustrations
showing that the Church would not consent to dictation
from the emperors, and that the clergy would not blindly
follow the patriarch. But, when dictation was supposed to
come from Rome, the great mass of clergy and people were,
as they had been from the time of Photius, on the side of
their Church and, if need be, against the emperor.</p>

<p>It must be remembered also that the Eastern Church
had steadily refused to admit the supremacy of the Western.
It had never regarded the phrase ‘under one fold and one
shepherd’ as indicating that the whole Church of Christ
should be under the government of one bishop. It had
never admitted that the ‘One Shepherd’ should be other
than Christ, and had therefore constantly denied the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>supremacy of the pope. One Empire, one Church, one
Head of the Church was a Western theory which had never
made much way in the later Roman empire. The movements
in the West which placed the imperial power in
commission, giving to the emperor the supreme secular, and
to the bishop of Rome the supreme ecclesiastical, authority
had no corresponding movement in the East. The emperors
were only heads of the Church in the same sense as the king
of England is in all matters ecclesiastical supreme. The
emperors and ecclesiastics were usually agreed in not allowing
the supremacy of the bishop of the elder Rome.</p>

<p>To the popes, however, the Union of the Churches was
indissolubly associated with the admission of papal supremacy.
It would be going too far to say that they desired
Union exclusively to obtain recognition of such supremacy,
but it may safely be said that they never lost sight in all
their negotiations for Union of the necessity of obtaining its
recognition, and that, in the opinion of many ecclesiastics
both Western and Eastern, such supremacy was the most
important object aimed at.</p>

<p>Murad’s unsuccessful attempt, in 1422, to capture Constantinople
made it evident to the emperor that aid from
Western nations was absolutely necessary if the empire or
even the city was to be saved. The pope also recognised
both the importance of saving the empire and its extreme
danger, and held out hopes of aid if Union were accepted.
The imminence of the danger was patent to all. When
John became sole occupant of the throne, in 1425, the
empire was surrounded by Turkish armies. Nearly the
whole of Asia Minor was in their hands. Large armies had
invaded Hungary; Bulgaria had ceased to exist; Serbia
was a vassal of the sultan. In Macedonia and even in
Thrace the Turks had made a desolation and held many
cities. If the city of Paris were worth a Mass, the
empire was worth a tenfold acknowledgment of the pope’s
supremacy.</p>

<p>The emperor, the nobles, and a considerable part of the
clergy came to believe that they must purchase aid on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
conditions or see the city captured. Questions of dogma, the
addition of the <i>Filioque</i> clause, the use of unleavened bread,
the condition of souls in purgatory, were to them matters
of secondary importance when the very existence of their
country was at stake. Even papal supremacy appeared to
John and many laymen worth accepting in return for the
despatch of soldiers who would resist the Turkish invasion.</p>

<p>We have seen that many attempts at Union had been
made by all the emperors since the recapture of the city,
but that they had all failed, that the traditional conservatism
of the Orthodox Church, its stubborn resistance
to the slightest change of dogma or ritual, all intensified by
the traditions of the Latin occupation, had been more powerful
than the energy and influence of popes and emperors
combined.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The great
attempt at
Reunion.</div>

<p>The last and greatest attempt to bring about a Union
was now about to be made, and deserves fuller notice than has
been given to any which preceded it.</p>

<p>In 1429, in the fourth year of his reign, John sent to
request the pope to despatch a messenger to Constantinople
to treat of Union. Eugenius gladly complied and sent a
friar to arrange conditions with the emperor and patriarch.
It was agreed that the canonical method of arriving at a
binding conclusion on matters of dogma should be adopted.
The matters in dispute were to be submitted to a Council of
the Church at which John and the patriarch were to be
present.</p>

<p>Meantime Eugenius employed his influence during the
next three or four years to induce the Venetians and
Genoese to unite against the common enemy, to give aid to
the knights in their defence of Rhodes, and to prevent any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>attacks upon the empire from the West. So far all looked
promising. Unfortunately, however, at this time the Latin
Church itself was divided. Rival popes, one in Italy, the
other at Avignon, had denounced each other as pretenders.
A Council of the Church opened at Bâle in March 1431 was
by a papal Bull ordered to be transferred to Bologna after
the expiry of eight months. The principal reason assigned
for the transfer was the greater convenience of John and the
imperial party. Eugenius had taken this step without
consultation with the cardinals, and the change of place
was at once strenuously opposed. A majority of the Council
refused to obey and replied that as the Bohemians, the
followers of John Huss, had been formally cited to appear at
Bâle, the place of meeting could not be changed. As to the
convenience of the representatives of the Greek Church, ‘the
peace of Germany is not to be sacrificed for the old song
which has rung in the ears of Europe for three centuries
and ended in nothing, the reconciliation of the Greek and
Latin Churches.’<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>The Council was supported in its opposition to Eugenius
by the Emperor Sigismund, by the duke of Milan, and
by many kings, princes, bishops, universities, and cities.
Only four cardinals remained on his side. Nevertheless he
fearlessly denounced the Council as a Synagogue of Satan.
For a while the more he threatened the more the dignitaries
of the Church flocked to Bâle. Eugenius in vain
endeavoured to extort from the Emperor Sigismund the
dissolution of the Council as the price of his consent to
place the imperial crown on his head. Sigismund would
not yield, and Eugenius had to crown him. With the
exception of Venice and Florence, all Western Europe was
against Eugenius. An insurrection in Rome forced him
to leave the city, and he escaped in a mean disguise. He
was driven for a while to withdraw his denunciations and
to admit the legality of the Council and of its acts.</p>

<p>A temporary reconciliation was of short duration. The
claims of the rival parties were incapable of reconciliation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>The Council was determined to limit the power of the pope;
the pope would endure no limitation.</p>

<p>Two years were lost in useless negotiations. John strongly
urged that the Council should consider the question of
Union without delay, and sent a representative to Bâle in
October 1433. When the members refused by a two-thirds
vote to remove to Italy the emperor’s representative
suggested that the meeting-place should be Constantinople.
The Council in 1434 declared against this proposal, but
offered to pay the expenses of the Greeks if they would
come to Bâle. The latter, possibly from their ignorance
of the geographical situation of the city, refused to go thither.
Other places were suggested and the pope again gave his
approbation for Bologna or some other place in Italy.</p>

<p>Representatives arrived in Constantinople from both the
Synod at Bâle and the pope, who were again in opposition
to each other. To such an extent had these hostilities
grown that the Council declared Eugenius guilty of perjury
and schism and incapable of holding any ecclesiastical
office. Eugenius retorted by calling them an assembly of
devils.</p>

<p>The deputies from Bâle brought with them to Constantinople
a comminatory decree of the Council against the
pope. The emperor and patriarch had therefore to choose
between the Council and Eugenius. Each had invited them,
had offered to bear the expenses and menaced them in case
of refusal. The deputies from Bâle were heard at a public
session of the Synod and threatened that if the Council
were not recognised, the nations of the West would make
war upon the empire, and this notwithstanding the aid of
the pope, whose decrees they insisted were null and void.
The ambassadors from Eugenius, who had arrived with
a band of three thousand crossbowmen, offered terms as to
transport and convoy similar to those which the messengers
from Bâle had proposed, and suggested that the proclamation
calling the meeting of the Council might be issued in the
emperor’s name. They were also heard in a public sitting
of the Synod in September 1437, a few days after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
audience of the deputies from Bâle. John and the patriarch
decided to accept the proposal of Eugenius.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>When the news reached the pope he at once issued a
Bull fixing Ferrara as the meeting-place of the Council. In
November 1437, the emperor, with a large suite, embarked.
The imperial party arrived at Venice in the following
February. The Venetians had been excommunicated by
the Council of Bâle as adherents of Eugenius, who was their
fellow-citizen, and, probably with a desire to induce the
Greeks to throw in their lot entirely on the side of the pope,
received John and the patriarch with unwonted honour.
The doge and the senate in the ‘Bucentaur,’ with the galleys
belonging to the republic and a crowd of gondolas, went out
to receive them. Lodging was found for their followers on
the Lido. Syropulus, who attended the patriarch and whose
history from the Greek point of view is the most trustworthy
narrative of these proceedings, was amazed at the display on
the reception in Venice. ‘You could as easily number the
leaves on the trees or the sands of the sea as the gondolas
and galleys of the Venetians.’ Phrantzes is not less
enthusiastic. He speaks of ‘Venice the marvellous, the
most marvellous: Venice the wise, the most wise; the city
predicted in the psalm, “God has founded her upon the
waters.”’<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>The Greeks were shown the treasures of St. Mark,
but Syropulus remarks that as they gazed upon them arose
the thought, ‘These were once our own. They are the
plunder of Hagia Sophia and our holy monasteries.’</p>

<p>Their departure for Ferrara was with a like magnificence.
Twelve noble galleys and an innumerable number of gondolas,
whose occupants and sailors were bright with silks of
various colours, attended them. The imperial eagles were
mingled with the gonfalons of St. Mark, and the city which
more than any other lends itself to display has seldom presented
a more brilliant spectacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime the pope had threatened excommunication
against the fathers of the Church who should continue to
sit at Bâle, and had given them four months within which to
present themselves at Ferrara. Their reply was a formal
deposition of Eugenius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First meeting
of
Council.</div>

<p>Upon the arrival of the imperial party at Ferrara and
after long negotiations regarding questions of precedence, it
was decided that the first meeting of the Council should be
held on March 9, 1438, and it was so held, the business
being merely formal. Four cardinals, twenty-five bishops,
and other nobles had previously received the patriarch and
conducted him to the pope, who rose from his throne, embraced
him, and led him to a seat near him similar to those
occupied by the cardinals. No decision could be taken
during the four months’ delay. As the recalcitrants did not
come in at the appointed time, a further postponement of
two months was granted, probably for the reason that the
pope knew that the princes of the West were still disposed
rather to sympathise with the Council than with him. All
this delay was in the highest degree irksome to the Greeks.
Many of them had left their homes without much hope of
arriving at a reconciliation, but when on reaching Ferrara
they realised the discord which existed in the Roman
Church itself not a few concluded that before anything
could be done to complete the Union a reconciliation must
take place among the Catholic factions themselves. During
their long wait the restrictions imposed upon their movements
aroused their suspicions. They complained that they were
treated as prisoners. They could not leave the city without
a permit. Three of the leading men who escaped to Venice
were ignominiously brought back. They again escaped and
this time found their way back to Constantinople. Nor was
the treatment of the ecclesiastics such as might have been
expected from hosts to guests. The bishop of Ferrara
refused to allow the Greeks to celebrate in one of his great
churches, declaring that he would not permit it to be polluted.
The emperor and patriarch, for political reasons
among others, were impatient to return, and did their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
utmost to urge on the work for which they had left their
homes.</p>

<p>In October the second meeting of the Council was held.
By this time a considerable number of the fathers of the
Church had made submission to Eugenius and had arrived
in Ferrara. Gibbon’s remark that ‘the violence of the
fathers of Basil rather promoted than injured the cause
of Eugenius’<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> is just. The delay had undoubtedly
strengthened the papal authority. Hence at the second
<span class="sidenote">Business
of Council
commences.</span>meeting of the Council its business began at once to progress.
Six Latin and six Greek theologians were selected
to formulate the questions in difference. These related to
the Procession of the Holy Ghost; the nature of the
penalties of purgatory; the condition of souls before the
last judgment; the use of unleavened bread in communion,
and lastly, the supremacy of the pope.</p>

<p>Meantime plague had broken out in Ferrara. Five only
out of the eleven cardinals remained, and all that had been
done was to formulate the points of difference. For some
reason which is not quite clear, the Council was transferred
to Florence. The unhealthiness of the city was alleged, but
Syropulus says that the plague had ended. The Greeks
were extremely reluctant to go to so remote a place as
Florence, but they finally consented, in the hope of speedily
concluding their mission.</p>

<p>At Florence the Council got fairly to work. Cardinal
Julian Cesarini, who had been president of the Council at
Bâle, and John, the head of the Dominicans in Italy, were
the champions on the Latin, and Isidore of Russia, Bessarion,
and Mark, bishop of Ephesus, on the Greek side.
Long, weary, and profitless discussions took place on the
subject of the Double Procession. Two questions were
involved: first, was the doctrine itself orthodox&mdash;that is, did
the Holy Ghost proceed from the Father alone or from the
Father and the Son; second, assuming the Double Procession
to be orthodox, by what authority had the Latin
Church, claiming to speak as the Universal Church, presumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>to add to the Nicene Creed the words <i>Filioque</i>, which proclaimed
the disputed dogma, before the decision of a General
Council had been pronounced. After many meetings among
the Greeks alone, it was decided that as the Latin Church
held that the Procession was not from two ‘principles’
but from one, and this by one operation, its teaching was in
accord with that of the Orthodox Church, which acknowledged
that the Procession is from the Father but through
the Son. The scholars who brought about this agreement
were Bessarion and George Scholarius, the latter of whom
was destined afterwards to play an important part during
the siege of Constantinople. The declaration of the Greeks
was approved at a meeting of the Council.</p>

<p>Greater difficulty arose on the second point, of the conduct
of the Latin Church in adding the clause to the Creed. The
emperor was at length convinced, or professed to be, that
the clause had formerly existed in the Creed at the time of
the Seventh Council,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> but it required all his influence to
persuade some of the Greek ecclesiastics who were not convinced
of this fact to avoid an open rupture. The debates
were obstinate and angry. But emperor and pope were
determined on Union, and each used all his influence and
authority to convince or compel the more refractory to
obedience. Finally, it was decided that the words <i>Filioque</i>
had been lawfully and with good reason inserted in the
Creed.</p>

<p>The question of purgatory and the condition of souls in
the intermediate state occasioned little or no difficulty. On
the use of unleavened bread, however, the controversy
became so violent that on five different occasions the Greek
bishops were with difficulty prevented from leaving the
Council. It was at length decided that each Church might
maintain its usage in regard thereto.</p>

<p>The most dangerous question, after that of the Double
Procession, regarded the pope’s supremacy, and was apparently
not made the subject of a public discussion.</p>

<p>In July 1439, after twenty-six sittings of the Council, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Union
accomplished,
July 14,
1439.</span>Union was signed and all was ready for its formal proclamation.
Earth and heaven were called upon to rejoice that the
dividing wall between the Churches of the West and East had
been broken down. In August, the Act of Union was published
with imposing solemnity in the cathedral and a <i>Te
Deum</i> was sung in Greek.</p>

<p>The embassy from Constantinople had been greatly
impressed by the dissensions among the Latins. No French or
German bishops had taken part in the meetings at Ferrara or
Florence. Fifty out of the sixty-two bishops who were present
were Italians, the remainder Spaniards or Burgundians.
When the latter were admitted to the Council they saluted
only the pope, doing this with the manifest intention of
slighting the emperor. The adherents of Bâle were,
indeed, openly hostile, and as they were known to have
great influence among the princes of the West, the Greeks
lost the illusion that if they came to an agreement with
the pope, aid would gladly be sent from the great Catholic
states.</p>

<p>It had been with difficulty that the emperor and the court
party in Constantinople had persuaded the Churchmen to go
to the West. While the former were willing to make many
sacrifices, even perhaps to accept the pope’s supremacy, in
the hope of obtaining aid against the Turks, when they
recognised that the influence of Eugenius was not what
they had believed it to be, they were less urgent, and certainly
less able, to coerce the distinguished ecclesiastics who
had been persuaded to accompany them. All were, indeed,
miserably disappointed and disillusionised. Though the
emperor never wavered in his determination to come to an
agreement which would aid in the preservation of his empire,
his own brother, Demetrius, refused to sign the Act of Union.
Mark of Ephesus would not attend at the solemn proclamation,
nor were George Scholarius or Gemistes or any of the
bishops from Georgia present. The bishop of Heraclia, on
his return to Venice, was required to recite the Creed in
St. Mark’s, but he did so with the omission of the <i>Filioque</i>
clause. The same bishop declared on his return to Constanti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>nople,
that he would rather his right hand had been cut off
than that it should have subscribed the Union. In order to
avoid the scandal of an open rupture, the four copies of the
decree did not mention the supremacy of the pope. Other
copies signed only by the Latin bishops were not recognised
as authentic by the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>The patriarch, a man of eighty, died just before the
decree of the Union was signed, and was buried in the Baptistery
of Florence. Religious animosity dogmatised over his
grave about his opinions. Some of the Greeks subsequently
pretended that his death was one of the several causes which
rendered the Council illegal. Some of the Latins maintained
that he had left a declaration of his acceptance of the Roman
doctrine, and even of the supremacy of the pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John returns
to
Constantinople,
August
1439.</div>

<p>The two persons who had shown themselves sincerely
desirous of accomplishing a Union were the pope and the
emperor. The former, who had paid the expenses of the
Greek mission, now urged foreign states to prepare and send
forth armies in aid of the Greeks. On the departure of John,
in August 1439, for his capital, the pontiff not merely promised
all the aid he could furnish, but undertook to maintain, at his
own expense as long as he lived, three hundred men in the
imperial service. He at once sent two well-armed galleys,
and declared that he would furnish twenty ships of war
during a period of six months. Eugenius and John had
loyally stood by each other, and so far as depended upon
them the Union had been accomplished.</p>

<p>With the object of giving effect to the decisions arrived
at, the pope retained Bessarion and Isidore, both of whom
he made cardinals. The latter, we shall see, was present at
Constantinople during the final siege. He was metropolitan
of Russia, and on his return to Moscow proclaimed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>Union. He gave dire offence by naming the emperor before
the grand duke, and the pope before the patriarch.</p>

<p>In 1442, the pope once again summoned certain princes,
and especially Ladislaus, king of Poland and Hungary, to
aid Constantinople, Cyprus, and Rhodes against the Turks.
He, however, was at war in Italy, and consequently unable
to furnish the aid which he had promised. Ladislaus was
permitted to retain the Peter’s pence on condition that he
would employ it in raising troops against the infidels. The
pope persuaded Alphonse of Aragon to furnish armed galleys,
and granted indulgences to all who sided in the struggle
against unbelievers. But all attempts to arouse a general
crusading spirit failed. With a few exceptions, those who
went to fight the battles of Christendom against Murad
belonged to nations whose vital interests were at stake.
Many causes contributed to this result, and among them
the awakening to new life in Italy. The Renaissance which
was now in progress substituted the classic spirit for the
Hebraic. Paganism itself, among scholars and statesmen,
was in competition with Christianity, and the great movement
which was destined to give birth to modern Europe and
which was greatly assisted, as we shall see, by the Greek
scholars from Constantinople, was antagonistic to the crusading
spirit. A common Christianity was no longer a bond of
union to those who were dreaming of a classic revival and of
a return to pagan ideals. Except to men who were outside
the influence of the new movement, the pope and churchmen
appealed in vain.</p>

<p>News of the accomplishment of the Union was received
in Constantinople with mingled feelings. Hopes had been
damped. The advantages to be gained by sacrificing their
Orthodox Faith were found to be doubtful. The conservative
party, led by Mark of Ephesus, gained greatly in strength.
Finding that the emperor had consented to the appointment
of a new patriarch who accepted the Union, Mark resumed
his denunciations both of it and of the Latin Church. The
patriarchs of Syria and Egypt refused to recognise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
decisions of Florence and threatened with excommunication
the priests ordained by the patriarch of Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of John, October 1448.</div>

<p>John lived nearly eight years after his return to Constantinople
from Florence and died in October 1448. The
events which happened during this interval relate principally
to the marvellous success of the Turks over the armies of
Central Europe, and will be better told in the story of their
progress. It is sufficient to say that these disasters hastened
his death.</p>

<p>During his reign the condition of the empire had undergone
little change. Though when first associated with his
father he had headed the war party, he recognised after the
siege of the city in 1422 that his father’s dying counsel to
keep on friendly terms with the Turks was wise. This
policy, as we have seen, did not prevent him from doing all
he could to obtain aid from the Western powers. He had
paid the price which Rome exacted and never lost hope that
such aid would come. At the same time he was ready to
join with the Hungarians and other Christian nations, even
at considerable risk of precipitating an attack upon the city.
His power, however, was too small to make any co-operation
outside the capital and the Straits of much value. He did
what he could. He repaired and strengthened the city
walls.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> He kept the fleet in at least as good a condition
as he had found it. He was probably justified in believing
that his wisest course was to obtain all the aid possible from
the West, to be ready to co-operate, and in the meantime to
keep quiet. His pliant policy delayed the siege of the city
and thus for a while averted the final calamity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is convenient to halt here and to retrace the steps of the
Ottoman conquerors from the accession of Manuel, in 1391,
with more care than was necessary in describing their direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
attacks upon the empire. The number of Turks in Asia
Minor and in Europe had now so much increased that their
leaders began to dream, perhaps were already planning,
the conquest of as wide a territory as had fallen before the
immediate successors of the prophet. They had already
almost succeeded in completing a ring of conquered states
round Constantinople itself. The defeat of the Bulgarians
and South Serbians on the Maritza, the great victory over
the Serbians at Cossovo-pol, in 1389, enabled them to join
forces with the Turks in the Morea and at isolated places
on the eastern shore of the Adriatic. Nearly all Asia
Minor acknowledged the rule of the Ottomans, and it was
to the European portion of the empire that the attention of
the Turk would now be turned.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>An observer looking back upon all that was going on in
Eastern Europe during the first half of the fifteenth century
can now see that all the great events were part of a gigantic
struggle against the hordes of Asia, represented by the
Turks on the south of the Danube and in Asia Minor and
the races whom it is convenient to call Tartars to the north
of that river. The humiliation of the emperors to obtain
aid from the West, the proceedings at Florence, the repeated
calls upon Hungary and other Christian nations, were all
incidents of that struggle. The statesmen of the West were
gradually learning that the Ottomans had developed into
a nation of fighters, and that it was not merely the remnant
of the Greek empire which was threatened, but Christendom
itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reign of Sultan Bajazed, 1389–1403.</div>

<p>Upon the assassination of Murad at Cossovo-pol, his
son Bajazed became sultan. He had already acquired, or acquired
shortly after his accession, the nickname of <i>Ilderim</i>
or the Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>He commenced his reign by strangling his elder brother,
Jacoub. Ducas declares that he was an irreconcilable enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>of the Christian name and a passionate follower of Mahomet.
During the reign of his predecessor, the struggle between
the empire and the Turks had taken a theological character,
and it is beyond reasonable doubt that religious animosity
of a kind which had not shown itself among the first armies
of the Turks had now diffused its baneful influence among
the Ottoman armies. Under Bajazed, this fanaticism was
intensified to such an extent that it led to cruelties of which
it may be said that it is hardly possible to believe that even
Mongol barbarity was ever greater than that exercised by
the followers of the successor of Murad against Christians.</p>

<p>The commencement of his reign was marked by a series
of rapid movements which were crowned with success. He
stands out in Turkish history as the maker of swift marches
and as the striker of sudden and effective blows. It was on
this account that he received the name of ‘Ilderim.’ He
forced Stephen of Serbia, the son of Lazarus (whom he had
caused to be hewn in pieces upon the assassination of Murad),
to become his vassal and to give him his sister in marriage.
Bulgaria, Wallachia, Albania, and Macedonia with Salonica
as its capital acknowledged his rule. His fleet plundered the
islands of the Archipelago and burnt the town of Chios.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reign of Manuel.</div>

<p>The last message the emperor John had received before
his death, in 1391, from Murad was that unless he destroyed
the work he had executed in repairing the towers of the
Golden Gate, he would put out the eyes of his son Manuel,
who was then at Brousa. Happily, his threat came to
naught. On learning of the death of his father, Manuel, as
we have seen, escaped to the capital. Thereupon Bajazed,
upon the rejection of his impossible demands, commenced
a series of attacks upon the empire.</p>

<p>Bajazed carried war into every part of the Balkan
peninsula. Durazzo was threatened by a Turkish army,
and the Venetian senate was compelled to send aid to the
relief of its signor. His armies employed themselves in</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>Thrace in raiding cattle and in capturing the Christian
inhabitants, thousands of whom were either killed or sold
into slavery. Tirnovo was taken, and Shishman, the king of
<span class="sidenote">End of Bulgarian kingdom.</span>
Bulgaria, made prisoner in 1393. With his death, in the
same year, the kingdom of Bulgaria came to an end. Ali
Pasha, the grand vizier of Bajazed, blockaded Manuel in
Constantinople, and urged the citizens to dethrone him and
declare for John, the son of Andronicus, the elder son of the
late emperor John. But after the Turks had continued
near the capital for upwards of a year, Manuel attacked and
defeated both them and his nephew John.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Morea was still under the rule of
the empire. Bajazed organised a great expedition of fifty
thousand men for its conquest. He captured Argos,
plundered the country nearly as far as Coronea and Methone,
in the Morea, and exterminated or brought away thirty
thousand captives.</p>

<p>In consequence of the success of these various expeditions,
the pope and the other princes of the West became
thoroughly alive to the necessity of putting forward all their
strength to check the Thunderbolt’s progress. Their hopes
centred in the leadership of Sigismund, king of Hungary
and brother of the emperor in the West. The Venetian
senate decided to treat with him for an alliance. The
pope and the chief of the Holy Roman Empire did
their best to engage the Christian powers to place themselves
under his leadership. In 1393, Sigismund had beaten
the Turks at Little Nicopolis, and hope rose high of greater
successes. In the spring of 1396, the duke of Burgundy, at
the head of a thousand knights and nine thousand soldiers&mdash;French,
English, and Italians&mdash;arrived in Hungary and
joined his forces. German knights also came in considerable
numbers. The Christian armies defeated the Turks in
Hungary, and gained victory in several engagements. The
emperor Manuel was secretly preparing to join them. Then
the allies prepared to strike a decisive blow. They gathered
on the banks of the Danube an army of at least fifty-two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
thousand&mdash;and possibly a hundred thousand&mdash;men, and encamped
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Nicopolis 1396.</span>
at Nicopolis. The <i>élite</i> of several nations were
present, but those of the highest rank were the French
knights. When they heard of the approach of the enemy,
they refused to listen to the prudent counsels of the Hungarians
and, with the contempt which so often characterised
the Western knights for the Turkish foe, they joined battle
confident of success.</p>

<p>Bajazed, as soon as he had learned the presence of the
combined Christian armies, marched through Philippopolis,
crossed the Balkans, made for the Danube, and then waited
for attack. In the battle which ensued (1396), Europe
received its first lesson on the prowess of the Turks, and
especially of the Janissaries. The Christian army, with
rash daring, broke through the line of its enemies, cut down
all who resisted them, and rushed on irresistible to the very
rearguard of the Turks, many of whom either retreated or
sought refuge in flight. When the French knights saw
that the Turks ran, they followed, and filled the battlefield
with dead and dying. But they made the old military
blunder, and it led to the same old result. The archers,
who always constituted the most effective Turkish arm,
employed the stratagem of running away in order to throw
their pursuers into disorder. Then they turned and made a
stand. As they did so, the Janissaries, ‘Christians of origin,
from many Christian nations,’ as Ducas bewails, came out
of the place where they had been concealed, surprised and
cut to pieces Frenchmen, Italians, and Hungarians. The
pursuers were soon the pursued. The Turks chased them
to the Danube, into which many of the fugitives threw
themselves. The defeat was complete. Sigismund saved
himself in a small boat, with which he crossed the river,
and found his way, after long wandering, to Constantinople.
The duke of Burgundy and twenty-four noblemen who
were captured were sent to Brousa to be held for ransom.
The remaining Burgundians, to the number of three
hundred, who escaped massacre, and refused to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
their lives by abjuring Christianity, had their throats cut by
order of the sultan.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>The battle at Nicopolis gave back to Bajazed almost at
once all that the allies had been able to take from him.
The defeat of Sigismund, with his band of French, German,
and Italian knights, sent dismay to their countrymen and
the princes of the West.</p>

<p>In the same year, Bajazed gained successes over the
Moslem prince of Caramania and a Turkish pretender at
Sinope, rebels who had been induced to rise in the hope that
they might take advantage of the attack of Sigismund and
his allies.</p>

<p>The sultan’s great object, however, was to complete his
triumphs by the capture of Constantinople. His grand
vizier had, in 1396, while blockading the city, urged the
inhabitants to declare for the young Prince John, who was
the Turkish <i>protégé</i>. On refusal, Bajazed sat down to
besiege the city, and only abandoned the idea of an assault
when it was pointed out that to do so would make enemies
of all the Christian powers.</p>

<p>In 1396, apparently immediately after the battle of
Nicopolis, and as an essential step towards the capture of
the city, he built on the Bosporus the castle still remaining
at Anatolia-Hissar, about six miles from the city. It
served at once, and continued to serve until 1453, as a
useful base of operations. After having completed it, says
Chalcondylas, he went to besiege Byzance, and summoned
Manuel to surrender the city.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> The emperor, who had just
welcomed six hundred French knights, sent by Charles the
Sixth of France, did not deign to reply. Two years later,
in 1398, in order to avoid an attack by the Turks, who were
drawing near the capital with an army numbering ten
thousand, nominally to support John, Manuel consented, as
we have seen, to share the throne with his nephew, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>thereupon went to Western Europe to endeavour to secure
help.</p>

<p>The aid sent to Sigismund from the West and that now
sent to the Bosporus under Boucicaut show that many
statesmen had awakened to the need of checking Turkish
progress. The empire was able for a while to hold its
own against the attacks made by the sultan.</p>

<p>Bajazed, whose life was alternately one of great activity
in warfare and of indescribable debauchery in the intervals
between his campaigns, had kept the capital under terror of
sieges during six weary years. In 1402, he summoned John
to surrender the city, and swore by God and the Prophet
that if he refused he would not leave in it a soul alive.
John gave a refusal. Chateaumorand, the lieutenant of
Boucicaut, who, as we have seen, had gone west to
endeavour to obtain aid, took charge of the defence, and
waited for an attack.</p>

<p>At this time, remarks Ducas, the empire was circumscribed
by the walls of Constantinople, for even Silivria was
in the hands of the Turks.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Bajazed had gained a firm
hold of Gallipoli and thus commanded the Dardanelles.
The long tradition of the Roman empire in the East, save
for the capture of the city itself, seemed on the eve of
coming to an end. No soldier of conspicuous ability had
been produced by the empire for upwards of half a century:
none who was capable of inflicting a sufficient defeat, or
series of defeats, on the Turks to break or seriously check
their power. The empire had fought on for three generations
against an ever increasing number of Turks, but
without confidence and almost without hope. It was now
lacking in sufficiency of men and money. The often
promised aid from the West had so far proved of little
avail. The armies defeated by the empire, either alone or
aided by Italians, were renewed by the constant stream of
immigrants from Asia. The power of Serbia had been
almost destroyed. Bulgaria had perished. The two states
had been alternately at the mercy of hordes of infidels from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>the north or those under the Turkish sultan. From
Dalmatia to the Morea the enemy was triumphant. The
men of Macedonia had everywhere fallen before Bajazed’s
armies. Constantinople was between the hammer and
anvil: Asia Minor, on the one side, was nearly all under
Turkish rule; the European part of the empire, on the
other, contained as many Turks as there were in Asia
Minor itself. The insolent tyrant passed in safety between
his two capitals&mdash;one at Brousa, the other at Adrianople&mdash;and
repeated his proud boasts of what he would do beyond
the limits of the empire. It seemed as if, with his overwhelming
force, he had only to succeed once more in a task
which, in comparison with what he and his predecessors had
done, was easy, and his success would be complete. He
would occupy the throne of Constantine, would achieve that
which had been the desire of the Arab followers of Mahomet,
and for which they had sacrificed hundreds of thousands of
lives, and would win for himself and his followers the
reward of heaven promised to those who should take part
in the capture of New Rome. The road to the Elder Rome
would be open, and he would yet feed his horse on the altar
of St. Peter.</p>

<p>We have seen what was the insolent message he sent
in his arrogance, in 1402, to John. The answer given
would have completed a dramatic story if it had seemed well
to the gods. ‘Tell your master we are weak, but that in our
weakness we trust in God, who can give us strength and can
put down the mightiest from their seats. Let your master
do what he likes.’ Thereupon Bajazed had laid siege to
Constantinople.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the blackness of darkness with which the
fortunes of the city were surrounded, there came a ray of
light. Had there been an interpreter there as of old time,
Bajazed might have learned the significance of the handwriting
on the wall. All thought of the siege was abandoned
for the time, and Constantinople breathed again
freely.</p>

<p>What had happened was that Timour the Lame had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
challenged, or rather ordered, Bajazed to return to the Greeks
all the cities and territories he had captured. The order
was categorical and, given to a ferocious barbarian like
Bajazed, drove him to fury. The man who gave it was,
however, accustomed to be obeyed.</p>

<p>Timour<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> or Tamarlane was a Mahometan and a Turk,
though he claimed to be of the same race as Genghis, who
was a Mongol. Under him the warrior shepherds of the
south plains of Asia came westward in even greater numbers
than they had done under his famous predecessor. They
advanced in well-organised armies, under generals who seem
to have had intelligence everywhere of the enemy’s country
and great military skill. After having annexed Kharizon
and Persia to Transoxiana and reduced Turkestan to
obedience, Timour turned westward. In 1386, he appeared
at Tiflis, which he subsequently captured at the head of an
enormous host estimated at eight hundred thousand men.
At Erzingan he put all the Turks sent there by the sultan
to the sword.</p>

<p>Bajazed seems from the first to have been alarmed and
went himself to Erzingan in 1394, but returned to Europe
without making any attempt to resist the invader, probably
believing that Timour had no intention of coming further
west.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> He soon learned his mistake. Timour was not
merely as great and cruel a barbarian but as ambitious as
Bajazed himself. In 1395, while the emperor was in the
Balkan peninsula, Timour summoned the large and populous
city of Sivas to surrender. The inhabitants twice
refused. Meantime, he had undermined the wall. On their
second refusal, his host stormed and captured the city. A
hundred and twenty thousand captives were massacred.
Bajazed’s son was made prisoner and put to death. A large
number of the prisoners were buried alive, being covered
over in a pit with planks instead of earth so as to prolong
their torture. Bajazed was relieved when he learned
that from Sivas, which had been the strongest place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>in his empire, the ever victorious army had gone towards
Syria.</p>

<p>Timour directed his huge host towards the frontier city
of the sultan of Egypt&mdash;namely, Aleppo&mdash;his object being to
punish the sultan for his breach of faith in imprisoning
his ambassador and loading him with irons. On his march
to that city, he spread desolation everywhere, capturing
or receiving the submission of Malatia, Aintab, and other
important towns. At Aleppo, the army of the Egyptian
sultan resisted. A terrible battle followed, but the
Egyptians were beaten, and every man, woman, and child in
the city was murdered.</p>

<p>After the capture of Aleppo, Hama and Baalbek were
occupied. The latter, which, like so many other once
famous cities, has become under Turkish rule a desolation
with only a few miserable huts amid its superb ruins, was
still a populous city, and contained large stores of provisions.
Thence he went to Damascus and in January 1401 defeated
the remainder of the Egyptian army in a battle which was
hardly less bloody than that before Aleppo. The garrison,
composed mostly of Circassian mamelukes and negroes,
capitulated, but the chief was put to death for having been
so slow in surrendering. Possibly by accident, the whole
city was burned.</p>

<p>Timour was stopped from advancing to Jerusalem by a
plague of locusts, which ate up every green thing. The
same cause rendered it impossible to attack Egypt, whose
sultan had refused to surrender Syria.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>From Damascus, Timour went to Bagdad, which was
held by contemporaries to be impregnable. Amid the heat
of a July day, when the defenders had everywhere sought
shade, Timour ordered a general assault, and in a few
minutes the standard of one of his sheiks, with its horsetail
and its golden crescent, was raised upon the walls.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>followed the usual carnage attending Timour’s captures.
The mosques, schools, and convents with their occupiers were
spared: so also were the <i>imaums</i> and the professors. All
the remainder of the population between the ages of eight
and eighty were slaughtered. Every soldier of Timour, of
whom there were ninety thousand, as the price of his own
safety, had to produce a head. The bloody trophies were, as
was customary in Timour’s army, piled up in pyramids
before the gates of the city.</p>

<p>It was on his return northwards from Damascus that, in
1402, Timour sent the message to Bajazed which at once
forced him to raise the siege of Constantinople. Contemporaneously
with this message, Timour requested the
Genoese in Galata and at Genoa to obtain aid from the West
and to co-operate with him to crush the Turkish sultan.</p>

<p>Timour organised or sent a large army on the Don and
around the Sea of Azof on the Cimmerian Bosporus,
connecting that sea with the Euxine, in order that, in case of
need, it might act with his huge host now advancing
towards the Black Sea from the south. His main body
<span class="sidenote">Bajazed’s reply to Timour’s summons.</span>
passed across the plain of Erzingan, and at Sivas Timour
received the answer of Bajazed. The response was as
insulting as a Turkish barbarian could make it. Bajazed
summoned Timour to appear before him and declared that
if he did not obey, the women of his harem should be
divorced from him, putting his threat in what to a Mahometan
was a specially indecent manner. All the usual
civilities in written communications between sovereigns
were omitted, though the Asiatic conqueror himself had
carefully observed them. Timour’s remark when he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>the sultan’s letter contained the name of Timour in black
writing under that of Bajazed which was in gold, was ‘The
son of Murad is mad!’ When he read the insulting threat
as to his harem, Timour kept himself well in hand, but,
turning to the ambassador who had brought the letter,
told him that he would have cut off his head and those of
the members of his suite if it were not the rule among
sovereigns to respect the lives of ambassadors. The representative
of Bajazed was, however, compelled to be present
at a review of the whole of his troops and was requested to
return to his master and relate what he had seen.</p>

<p>Meantime, Bajazed had determined to strike quickly and
heavily against Timour and by the rapidity of his movements
justified the name of Ilderim. His opponent’s forces,
however, were hardly less mobile. Timour’s huge army
marched in twelve days from Sivas to Angora. The officer
in command of that city refused to surrender. Timour
made his arrangements for the siege in such a manner as to
compel or induce Bajazed to occupy a position where he
would have to fight at a disadvantage. He undermined the
walls and diverted the small stream which supplied it with
water. Hardly had these works been commenced before he
learned that Ilderim was within nine miles of the city.
Timour raised the siege and transferred his camp to the
opposite side of the stream, which thus protected one side of
his army while a ditch and a strong palisade guarded the
other. Then in an exceptionally strong position he waited
to be attacked.</p>

<p>Disaffection existed in Bajazed’s army, occasioned by his
parsimony, and possibly nursed by emissaries from Timour.
Bajazed’s own licentiousness had been copied by his
followers, and discipline among his troops was noted as far
less strict than among those of his predecessor. In leading
them on what all understood to be the most serious enterprise
which he had undertaken, his generals advised him to
spend his reserves of money freely so as to satisfy his
followers; but the capricious and self-willed Ilderim refused.
They counselled him, in presence of an army many times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
more numerous than his own, to act on the defensive and to
avoid a general attack. But Bajazed, blinded by his long
series of successes, would listen to no advice and would take
no precautions. In order to show his contempt for his
enemy, he ostentatiously took up a position to the north of
Timour and organised a hunting party on the highlands in
the neighbourhood, as if time to him were of no consequence.
Many men of his army died from thirst under the burning
sun of the waterless plains, and when, after three days’
hunting, Bajazed returned to his camping ground, he found
that Timour had taken possession of it. The enemy had
almost altogether cut off his supply of drinking water and
had fouled what still remained.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, Bajazed had no choice but
to force on a fight without further delay. The ensuing
battle was between two great Turkish leaders filled with the
arrogance of barbaric conquerors, each of whom had been
almost uniformly successful. Nor were pomp and circumstance
wanting to impress the soldiers of each side with
the importance of the issue. Each of the two leaders was
accompanied by his sons. Four sons and five grandsons
commanded the nine divisions of Timour’s host. In front
of its leader floated the standard of the Red Horse-tail
surmounted by the Golden Crescent. On the other side,
Bajazed took up his position in the centre of his army
with his sons Isa, Mousa, and Mustafa, while his eldest son
Suliman was in command of the Asiatic troops who formed
the right wing. Lazarus of Serbia was in command of his
own subjects, who had been forced to accompany Bajazed
and formed the left wing of the army. The Serbians gazed
in wonder and alarm upon a number of elephants opposite
to them, which Timour had brought from India.</p>

<p>At six o’clock in the morning of July 28, 1402, the two
armies joined battle. The left wing of Bajazed’s host was
the first to be attacked, but the Serbians held their ground
and even drove back the Tartars. The right wing fought
with less vigour, and when the troops from Aidin saw their
former prince among the enemy, they deserted Bajazed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
went over to him. Their example was speedily followed by
many others, and especially by the Tartars in the Ottoman
army, who are asserted by the Turkish writers to have been
tampered with by agents of Timour.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of Bajazed.</div>

<p>The Serbians were soon detached from the centre of the
army, but Lazarus, their leader, at the head of his cavalry,
cut his way through the enemy, though at great loss, winning
the approval of Timour himself, who exclaimed, ‘These
poor fellows are beaten, though they are fighting like lions.’
Lazarus had advised Bajazed to endeavour, like himself, to
break through, and awaited him for some time. But the
sultan expressed his scorn at the advice. Surrounded by
his ten thousand trustworthy Janissaries, separated from
the Serbians, abandoned by a large part of his Anatolian
troops and many of his leading generals, he fought on obstinately
during the whole of the day. But the pitiless heat
of a July sun exhausted the strength of his soldiers, and no
water was to be had. His Janissaries fell in great numbers
around him, some overcome by the heat and fighting, others
struck down by the ever pressing crowd of the enemy. It
was not till night came on that Bajazed consented to withdraw.
He attempted flight, but was pursued. His horse
fell, and he was made prisoner, together with his son Mousa
and several of the chiefs of his household and of the Janissaries.
His other three sons managed to escape. The
Serbians covered the retreat of the eldest, Suliman, whom
the grand vizier and the Aga of the Janissaries had dragged
out of the fight.</p>

<p>The Persian, Turkish, and most of the Greek historians
say that Timour received his great captive with every mark
of respect, assured him that his life would be spared, and
assigned to him and his suite three splendid tents. When,
however, he was found attempting to escape, he was more
rigorously guarded and every night put in chains and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>fined
in a room with grilled windows. When he was conveyed
from one place to another, he travelled much as Indian ladies
now do, in a palanquin with curtained windows. Out of a
misinterpretation of the Turkish word which designated at
once a cage and a grilled room, grew the error into which
Gibbon and historians of less repute have fallen that the
great Ilderim was carried about in an iron cage.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Until his
death, in 1403, he was an unwilling follower of his captor.</p>

<p>After the battle of Angora, Suliman (the eldest son of
Bajazed), who had fled towards Brousa, was pursued by a
detachment of Timour’s army. He managed to cross into
Europe and thus escaped. But Brousa, the Turkish capital,
fell before Timour’s attack, and its inhabitants suffered the
same brutal horrors as almost invariably marked either Tartar
or Turkish captures. The city, after a carefully organised
pillage, was burned. The wives and the daughters of Bajazed
and his treasure became the property of Timour. Nicaea
and Ghemlik were also sacked and their inhabitants taken
as slaves. From the Marmora to Caramania, many towns
which had been captured by the Turks were taken from
them. Asia Minor was in confusion. Bajazed’s empire
appeared to be dropping away in every part east of the
Aegean. Suliman, however, established himself on the
Bosporus at Anatolia-Hissar, and about the same time both
he and the emperor at Constantinople received a summons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>from Timour to pay tribute. The emperor had already
sent messengers to anticipate such a demand. Timour
learned with satisfaction that the sons of Bajazed were disputing
with each other as to the possession of such parts of
their father’s empire as still remained uncaptured by him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Timour captures Smyrna.</div>

<p>In 1402, the conqueror left Kutahia for Smyrna, which
was held, as it had been for upwards of half a century, by the
Knights of Rhodes. In accordance with the stipulation of
Moslem sacred law, he summoned them either to pay
tribute or become Mahometans, threatening them at the
same time that if they refused to accept one or other of these
conditions all should be killed. No sooner were the proposals
rejected than Timour gave the order to attack the
city. With his enormous army, he was able to surround
Smyrna on three sides, and to block the entrance to it from
the sea. The ships belonging to the knights were at
the time absent. All kinds of machines then known for
attack upon walled towns were constructed with almost
incredible speed and placed in position. The houses within
the city were burned by means of arrows carrying flaming
materials steeped in naphtha or possibly petroleum, though,
of course, not known under its modern name.</p>

<p>After fourteen days’ vigorous siege, a general assault was
ordered, and the city was taken. The knights fought
like heroes, but were driven back into the citadel. Seeing
that they could no longer hold out, and their ships having
returned, the grand master placed himself at their head, and
he and his knights cut their way shoulder to shoulder
through the crowd of their enemies to the sea, where they
were received into their own ships. The inhabitants who
could not escape were taken before Timour and, without
distinction of age or sex, were butchered.</p>

<p>The Western settlers hastened to come to terms with
Timour, who, like his great predecessor, was not opposed to
any Christians on account of their religion. The Genoese
in Phocaea, in the islands of Mitylene and Scios, sent to
make submission, and became tributaries of the conqueror.</p>

<p>Smyrna was the last of Timour’s conquests in western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Asia Minor. He went to Ephesus, and during the thirty
days he passed in that city his army ravaged the whole of
the fertile country in its neighbourhood and in the valley of
the Cayster. The cruelties committed by his horde would
be incredible if they were not continually repeated during
the course of Tartar and Turkish history. In fairness, it
must also be said that the Ottoman Turks, although their
history has been a long series of massacres, have rarely been
guilty of the wantonness of cruelty which Greek and Turkish
authors agree in attributing to the Tartar army. One
example must suffice. The children of a town on which
Timour was marching were sent out by their parents reciting
verses from the Koran to ask for the generosity of their conqueror
but co-religionist. On asking what the children were
whining for, and being told that they were begging him to
spare the town, he ordered his cavalry to ride through them
and trample them out: an order that was forthwith obeyed.</p>

<p>Timour, wearied with victories in the west, now determined
to leave Asia Minor and return to Samarcand. This
resolution he carried out. He contemplated the invasion of
<span class="sidenote">Death of Timour.</span>
China, but in the midst of his preparations died, in 1405,
after a reign of thirty-six years.</p>

<p>Bajazed the Thunderbolt died at Aksheir two years
earlier, and his son Mousa was permitted to transport his
body to Brousa.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>The battle of Angora gave the greatest check to the
Ottoman power which it had yet received. Considering the
number of men engaged and the complete victory obtained
by Timour, one might have expected it to have been fruitful
in more enduring consequences than it produced. But its
immediate results, though not far-reaching, were important.
The fourteen years’ victorious career of the Thunderbolt was
brought suddenly to an end. The empire of the Ottoman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Turks which he had largely increased, and especially by the
addition to it of the north-west portion of Asia Minor, was
for a time shattered to pieces. The sons of the vanquished
sultan, after the departure of Timour and his host, were
quarrelling over the possession of what remained. Three of
them gained territories in Asia Minor, while the eldest,
Suliman, retook possession of the lands held by his father
in Europe. Most of the leaders of the Ottoman host, the
viziers, governors, and scheiks, had been either captured or
slain, and in consequence the sons of Bajazed fighting in
Asia Minor found themselves destitute of efficient servants
for the organisation of government in the territories which
they seized on the departure of Timour.</p>

<p>The progress of the great Asiatic horde created a profound
impression in Western Europe. The eagerness of
the Genoese to acknowledge the suzerainty of Timour gives
an indication of their sense of the danger of resistance. The
stories of the terrible cruelties of the Tartars lost nothing in
their telling. When the news reached the neighbouring
nations of Hungary and Serbia and the republics of Italy
of the defeat of Bajazed, the capture of Brousa, of Smyrna,
of every other town before which the Asiatic army had sat
down, and of the powerlessness of the military knights, it
appeared as if the West were about to be submerged by a new
flood from Asia. No terror so great had threatened Europe
since the time when Charles Martel defeated the Moslem
hordes on the plains around Tours, or since the even more
threatening attack upon Christendom when the main body
of the Arab armies sat down for successive years before
Constantinople and were signally defeated by the obstinacy
of its defenders.</p>

<p>Then, when news came of the sudden departure of the
Asiatics and of the breaking up of the Ottoman power, hope
once more revived, and it appeared possible to the pope and
Christian peoples to complete the work which Timour had
begun by now offering a united opposition to the restoration
of an Ottoman empire. Constantinople itself when Bajazed
passed it on his way to Angora was almost the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
remnant of the ancient empire, and seemed as if it required
only one more attempt, and that not needing that the sultan
should put forth all his strength, to secure its capture. The
battle of Angora saved it and gave it half a century more of
life.</p>

<p>A struggle which lasted for six years began between the
sons of Bajazed. Suliman, in 1405, sought to ally himself
with the emperor, and his proposals show how low the
battle of Angora had brought the Turkish pretensions. He
offered to cede Salonica and all country in the Balkan
peninsula to the south-west of that city as well as the towns
on the Marmora to Manuel and his son John, now associated
as emperor, and to send his brother and sister as hostages
to Constantinople. The arrangement was accepted.</p>

<p>Suliman, having thus made himself secure, attacked his
brother Isa in 1405, defeated and killed him.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> Another
brother, Mousa, in the following year, attacked the combined
troops of Suliman and Manuel in Thrace, but the Serbians
and Bulgarians deserted the younger brother, and thereupon
Suliman occupied Adrianople. Manuel consented to give
his granddaughter in marriage to Suliman, who in return
gave up not merely Salonica but many seaports in Asia
Minor: a gift which was rather in the nature of a promise
than a delivery, since they were not in his possession.
Unhappily, Suliman, like many of his race, had alternate
fits of great energy and great lethargy, and was given over
to drunkenness and to debauchery. This caused disaffection
among the Turks; and Mousa, taking advantage of it, led
an army in 1409, composed of Turks and Wallachs, against
him. The Janissaries, who were dissatisfied with the lack
of energy displayed by their sultan, deserted and went over
to the side of Mousa. Suliman fled with the intention of
escaping to Constantinople, but was captured while sleeping
off a drinking bout and killed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>
<p>Then Mousa determined to attack Manuel, who had been
faithful to his alliance with Suliman. He denounced him
as the cause of the fall of Bajazed and set himself to arouse
all the religious fanaticism possible against the Christian
population under the emperor’s rule. According to Ducas,
Mousa put forward the statements that it was the emperor
who had invited Timour and his hordes, that his own
brother Suliman had been punished by Allah because he
had become a giaour, and that he, Mousa, had been entrusted
with the sword of Mahomet in order to overthrow
the infidel. He therefore called upon the faithful to go with
him to recapture Salonica and the other Greek cities which
had belonged to his father, and to change their churches
into mosques for the worship of God and Mahomet.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>In 1412, he devastated Serbia for having supported his
brother, and this in as brutal a manner as Timour had
devastated the cities and countries in Asia Minor. Then he
attacked Salonica. Orchan, the son of Suliman, aided the
Christians in the defence of the city, which, however, was
forced to surrender, and Orchan was blinded by his uncle.</p>

<p>While successful on land Mousa was defeated at sea,
and the inhabitants of the capital, in 1411, saw the destruction
of his fleet off the island of Plataea in the Marmora. In
revenge for this defeat he laid siege to the city. Manuel
and his subjects stoutly defended its landward walls, and
before Mousa could capture it news came of the revolt of
his younger brother, Mahomet, who appeared as the avenger
of Suliman. The siege of Constantinople had to be raised.
Mahomet had taken the lordship of the Turks in Caramania
shortly after the defeat of his father at Angora, and had
been unattacked by Timour. The emperor proposed an
alliance with him, which was gladly accepted and the conditions
agreed to were honourably kept by both parties.
Mahomet came to Scutari where he had an interview with
the emperor. An army formed of Turks and Greeks was
led by Mahomet to attack his brother. But Mousa defeated
him in two engagements. Then Manuel, after a short time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>having been joined by a Serbian army, attempted battle
against him, and with success. The Janissaries deserted
Mousa and went over to Mahomet and Manuel, and his army
was defeated. He was himself captured and by order of
Mahomet was bowstrung.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>Mahomet was now the only survivor of the six sons of
Bajazed, with the exception of Isa, the youngest, who was
still living with Manuel as a hostage. Three of his brothers
<span class="sidenote">Sultan Mahomet the First, 1413–1420.</span>
had been the victims of fratricide. In 1413, Mahomet proclaimed
himself Grand Sultan of the Ottomans.</p>

<p>He had been loyally aided by Manuel and the Serbians,
and in return loyally respected the agreements he had made
with both. He gave up, as we have seen, Salonica and the
fortified towns on the Euxine, the Marmora and in Thessaly
which had been taken from the Greeks.</p>

<p>In 1415, the Turks, who had remained nearly undisturbed
on the western side of the Balkans, entered Bosnia. The
inhabitants were mostly Bogomils, who had been constantly
persecuted by their Catholic neighbours in order to force
them to Union with the Church of Rome, were menaced,
on account of their refusal, by the king of Hungary, and in
reply threatened that they would coalesce with the Turks.
Upon such an intimation, the Turks entered the country.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>The two rulers, Manuel and Mahomet, continued on
friendly terms. It was probably due to the emperor’s
influence that the sultan consented, in 1415, to allow the
Knights of Rhodes to build a strong fortification on the
boundaries of Caria and Lycia as a place of refuge for
Christians who should escape from the hands of the Moslems.
Ducas gives an account of the interview which took place
between the grand master and Manuel and adds that the
emperor went so far towards conciliating the Christians that
he contented the rulers of Chios, Mitylene, and Phocaea. In
returning from the Morea in 1416, Manuel met Mahomet at
Gallipoli, the sultan going on board Manuel’s galley and
eating with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>Two years later, the good understanding between
Mahomet and the emperor was interrupted by an incident
which is creditable to Manuel. A Turkish pretender who
claimed to be Mustafa, the elder brother of the sultan,
who is supposed to have been killed at Angora, aided by a
body of Wallachs, attempted to dethrone Mahomet. They
were attacked and beaten back and then took refuge in
Salonica. Manuel declined to give them up, but promised
that he would prevent the pretender and the leader of the
Wallachs from making further attacks upon Mahomet. To
accomplish this, he sent the pretender Mustafa to the island
of Lemnos and imprisoned the chief of the Wallachs in
the monastery of Pammacaristos in Constantinople. But
Mahomet would not be satisfied with any punishment less
than the death of the pretender, and from this time ceased
to trust Manuel. Nevertheless, when, in 1420, the sultan
was in passage through Constantinople towards his Asiatic
possessions, Manuel behaved loyally. All the members of
his council, says Phrantzes,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> advised the emperor to seize him.
Manuel refused and declared that, though the sultan might
violate his oath of friendship, he would rather trust to God
and respect his own. On Mahomet’s return to Europe
through Gallipoli, the council again urged the emperor to
capture him. Again, however, he refused, and sent a trusty
<span class="sidenote">Death of Mahomet.</span>
general to escort him from the Dardanelles to Adrianople.
A short time after his arrival, in 1420, Mahomet died.</p>

<p>His death was kept secret for forty days, in order to give
time for the arrival of his son, Murad, who was then at
<span class="sidenote">Reign of Murad, 1420–1451.</span>
Amasia. Murad was proclaimed at Brousa and began his
reign by proposing to Manuel the renewal of the alliance
which had existed with his father. We have already seen
that this proposal was rejected, and that, after fruitless
negotiations for the surrender of two of Murad’s sons, war
was declared. The emperor thereupon sent to Mustafa the
pretender, who still remained prisoner at Lemnos, and, giving
him assistance, recognised or appointed him governor of
Thrace and of all the places in that province held by the Turks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>which he could occupy. In return, Mustafa swore to deliver
Gallipoli, which had been taken by the Turks in the reign
of Bajazed, to the emperor as soon as he had captured it,
as well as certain towns on the Black Sea. Mustafa
succeeded for a while and with the aid of the imperial
troops captured Gallipoli (1420). A number of its Turkish
garrison joined his army. Manuel’s general now claimed
the fulfilment of his promise to deliver this important town,
but Mustafa stated what has often been advanced in our
own time as a generally recognised rule in Islam, that a
true believer could not surrender to unbelievers territory
held by Moslems except by force, that his religion bound
him to build a city on the ruins of the Christian city, and
that he would rather break his oath than violate the duty
imposed by his religion. It was in vain that the emperor’s
representative reminded him of his past history: how he had
sought refuge at Salonica, how the emperor had risked the
anger of Mahomet by insisting upon his refusal to give him
up; how at Lemnos he had still been protected. The
pretender was obdurate.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>When Manuel heard of the bad faith of Mustafa, he
endeavoured to re-establish the same friendly relation with
Murad which had existed with his father. He offered to
assist the sultan to recover all that his father possessed,
provided he would send his sons to Constantinople.
According to Phrantzes (who from this time takes an active
part in many of the incidents he relates), the sultan was
equally ready to be friendly, provided that no further aid
should be given to Mustafa,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> but no understanding could be
arrived at.</p>

<p>The perjured Mustafa was probably a very poor creature.
He soon lost the confidence of his followers, and shut
himself in Gallipoli, giving himself up to pleasures and
paying little attention to the measures which Murad was
taking against him. The latter passed over into Asia, made
arrangements with the Genoese at Phocaea to send him
a fleet and a number of Italian and French soldiers, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>when they arrived, crossed the Dardanelles from Lampsacus
to Gallipoli.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>The troops who remained faithful to the pretender
attempted to prevent the landing of Murad and his native
and foreign troops, but failed. Thereupon Mustafa fled.
Murad took possession of Gallipoli and then followed the
pretender to Adrianople with all possible speed. Mustafa
hastened towards Wallachia on the approach of the sultan.
A band of young soldiers followed and captured him. He
was brought before the sultan, condemned, and hanged like
an ordinary malefactor.</p>

<p>Then the sultan thought himself strong enough to take
up the task which Bajazed had undertaken when summoned
by Timour. He decided at once to attempt the capture of
Constantinople. He laid siege to it in the second week of
June 1422 and ended in failure, as we have already seen, at
the end of August in the same year.</p>

<p>One at least of the reasons why the siege in 1422 had
been abandoned was a rising against Murad on behalf of
his younger brother named Mustafa. One of his two
brothers, had been strangled by his orders, but Mustafa
was saved by Elias Pasha. Murad had ordered Elias to
bring the boy to Brousa. Elias, however, succeeded in
having him recognised in that city and at Nicaea as sultan.
The rebellion, therefore, had assumed alarming proportions.
Murad with a trusty band of followers went to Nicaea, gained
access to the city, and the boy Mustafa, who was only
six years old, was bowstrung, possibly without the consent
of his brother. Then Murad in great haste crossed again to
Europe,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> occupied Adrianople, and made it his European
capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>We have now arrived at the period when many of those
who were destined to be great actors in the tragedy of the
Moslem conquest of Constantinople appear on the scene.
The young emperor John, who had become co-emperor with
his father in 1420 and who now alone possessed power,
owing to the debility of his father, went, in 1423, to Hungary
to seek help against the common enemy. He left his
brother Constantine, who was destined to be the last
Christian emperor of the city, in charge of the capital with
the title of Despot. A few months later, Phrantzes, the
historian of the conquest, and Lucas Notaras, afterwards
made Grand Duke, who also took a prominent part in the
events of 1453, were sent by Constantine to Murad and
arranged terms of peace, subject to ratification by John,
when he returned from Hungary. The associated emperor
came back by sea to his capital in October and terms of
peace were ratified by which the empire had to pay a heavy
tribute and to surrender many towns on the Black Sea.</p>

<p>In July 1425, Manuel died. He was seventy-seven
years old and had reigned thirty-four years&mdash;or, counting the
eighteen years when he was co-emperor with his father,
fifty-two years. In his old age, he had become hopeless of
saving the empire, or even the capital. He counselled John
to make the best of the situation, to try to live on good terms
with the sultan, and to be content to remain the vassal of
Murad.</p>

<p>The Turks had now largely recovered from the disorganization
produced by the invasion of Timour. Everywhere
they were regaining territory, and their internal
divisions were disappearing. Those occupying the south and
south-west of Asia Minor were the first to recover from the
blow of the Tartars. As early as 1415, Manuel had to resist
them in the Morea. They had defeated the Venetians, had
plundered Euboea and carried off thousands of Christian
captives. Others had invaded Dalmatia and the Adriatic
coast. Their numbers in Hungary and south Russia had
been enormously increased by the conquests of Timour, the
Turks of south Russia fleeing before his host. In 1419, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Hungarians had defeated an army of three hundred thousand
who entered the great plain north of the Danube. Most
of the Turks in Asia Minor, if not all willing subjects of
Murad, still rendered him at the time of the death of Manuel,
in 1425, a nominal submission. The prince of Caramania
was, however, always a troublesome feudatory.</p>

<p>Murad’s reputation may be judged by the fact that in
the year in which Manuel died he made a triumphal progress.
Having traversed Thrace, he went to Brousa, to
Pergamos, Magnesia, Smyrna, and Ephesus. While at
the last-mentioned city, homage was done to him by the
ambassadors of the emperor John, of Lazarus, king of
Serbia, Dan, prince of the Wallachs, and the signors of
Mitylene, Chios, and Rhodes. He was, in fact, the almost
undisputed lord of Asia Minor and of all places in the
Balkan peninsula, with the exception of a few fiefs in Greece,
and of Constantinople, with a small territory behind it. With
the exception of the Venetians and the Hungarians, he was
at peace with all the world. But the Venetians were still
holding their own. They had supported the insurrection in
Caramania. Their fleet had been sent to prevent Murad
from crossing into Asia, and they were masters of Salonica.
But even in that city Murad had still a triumph to achieve.
Pressed by famine when the inhabitants were besieged by
the Turks, shortly before Murad’s siege of the capital, the
population had offered the city to the Venetians, who gladly
accepted it and sent a fleet to its relief. But the Turks had
constantly claimed that they had been improperly deprived
of their intended prey, and the answer given by Murad to
proposals of peace made by the republic were: Surrender
Salonica first. In 1428, Murad determined to fight for it.
While he went south-west into Macedonia, the whole
population, including the southern Serbs and southern
Bulgarians, submitting to his rule, one of his leading
generals laid siege to Salonica. Ducas says that the
besiegers were a hundred to one, and there can be no doubt
that there was a fatal discrepancy in numbers. On the
arrival of Murad, the Janissaries were promised permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
to pillage the city. In a general assault, they captured it
without much difficulty, and the brutalities, the atrocities,
the wanton and useless cruelties inflicted upon the population
made a profound impression upon Western Christians.
Probably they learned more of the nature of these cruelties,
owing to the presence of Italians and the comparative
proximity of Salonica to Western Europe, than ever before.
But though women were violated, houses pillaged, churches
profaned, and seven thousand of the captives sold into
slavery, Europe did not yet understand that these were
the ordinary incidents of Turkish conquest. Upon the
capture of the city, in 1430, Murad and the Venetians made
peace.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>Great efforts, however, were yet to be made to check the
progress of Murad, and if in the course of his triumphal
progress to Ephesus he was under the illusion that the
European nations were content to allow Moslem invasion to
remain unchecked, he was soon undeceived. Hungary,
Serbia, and Poland now formed the great line of defence
against a Turkish advance, and when, in 1428, the first two
states were invaded by the Turks, it became evident to the
West that Catholic as well as Orthodox nations would have
to resist the progress of Turkish arms. Before the nations
attacked were ready, Murad struck swiftly and heavily, and
Sigismund, king of Hungary, not having received the aid
he expected from Ladislaus, king of Poland, suffered a
serious disaster on the Danube.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations to resist Murad.</div>

<p>On receiving news of the Turkish advance, the pope once
more preached a new Crusade and called upon all Christians
to go to the aid of the Poles and Hungarians. But messengers
travelled slowly, and preparations were long. Four years
afterwards, in 1433, Murad again invaded Hungary, but was
stoutly resisted by Elizabeth, mother of the infant Ladislaus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>and had to retire. In withdrawing he attempted to annex
Serbia, on the pretext that Bajazed having married the
sister of Stephen, the former sovereign, the crown belonged
to him as the heir of Ilderim. In 1435, he laid siege to
Belgrade, and put out the eyes of two sons of the kral,
under the pretext that they had attempted to escape to their
father. The siege lasted six months, but the attempt failed.
The Serbians defended the city bravely. The Turkish army
suffered from malarial fever, and a relieving army under a
Polish general compelled them to raise the siege.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that during the absence of the
emperor at Ferrara and Florence in order to treat of the
Union of the Churches&mdash;an absence from his capital of two
years and two months (November 1437 to February 1440)&mdash;Murad
proposed to attack the city and was advised to do so
by all his council with the exception of Halil pasha,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> who
pointed out that as John had gone to confer with the representatives
of the Christian powers on questions of religion, at
the request of the pope, they would feel bound to come to
his aid, if advantage were taken of his absence to attack
the capital. Halil’s advice was taken.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>Immediately on John’s return, he and other European
Christian rulers began to make more or less combined
movements against Murad. The influence of the pope was
energetically used to make an alliance successful. The
question was no longer one merely of defending a schismatic
though Christian emperor, but of preserving the existence of
great Catholic states. Nor were the means for offering
a strong resistance to Turkish advance wanting. The
crown of Hungary was worn by Ladislaus, the young king
of Poland, who was crowned in 1440. Almost immediately
after his accession, his army succeeded in defeating a
Turkish detachment in Hungary. In the same year Scanderbeg&mdash;that
is, Alexander Bey&mdash;at the head of a large body of
Albanians, declared war on Murad. Though John on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>return from Florence sent an embassy to the sultan to
protest that he was a loyal vassal, he was only waiting for
the ships and aid promised by the pope and by Western
princes in order to join in a combined attack. Although the
ships promised were long in arriving, the West was known to be
full of anxiety, and preparations were being hurried forward.
On New Year’s Day 1442, the pope again preached a Crusade
and called on all Christian princes, and especially on Ladislaus,
king of Poland and Hungary, to help in the defence of the
three bulwarks of Christendom&mdash;Constantinople, Cyprus, and
Rhodes.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Cardinal Julian was commissioned to advise Ladislaus,
and the king was ordered to render every aid possible
to him as the legate of Eugenius. George Brancovich of
Serbia bound himself to aid the Hungarian king and for this
purpose to send twenty-five thousand men and large sums of
money, the produce of the Serbian mines. The combined
army of Hungarians and Serbs, with the co-operation also of
Scanderbeg, was placed in June under the command of
John Corvinus Hunyadi, the waywode of Transylvania.
<span class="sidenote">Hunyadi leader of Christian armies.</span>
Hunyadi had already distinguished himself as a brave and
skilful leader against the Turks. In a short campaign of
less than half a year, he had captured five strongholds north of
the Danube, won as many battles, and had returned laden with
booty and trophies of victory. In 1442, at the head of
twelve thousand chosen cavalry, he chased the Turks out of
Serbia and defeated in succession several armies. Christians
from France, Italy, and Germany hastened to enrol themselves
under his leadership. Not even before the terrible
disaster at Nicopolis in 1396 had so powerful an army been
gathered together to attack the common enemy as was
now collected under Hunyadi. It represented all the force
that the pope and Western Europe could muster, and the
presence of Cardinal Julian gave it the sanction of an
international army representing Christendom. Seldom have
soldiers had more confidence in their leader, and apparently
that confidence was well bestowed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">His victories.</div>

<p>Near Nisch the army of twelve thousand chosen cavalry
under Hunyadi was joined by that of Ladislaus, consisting of
twenty thousand men, with whom were the king and the
cardinal. The first and most important battle of the
campaign with the united army was fought between Sofia
and Nisch, probably near Slivnitza on November 3, 1443.
The Turks were completely defeated, and thirty thousand of
them are said to have been left on the field. Four thousand
were made prisoners and nine standards captured. Thereupon
the Christian army advanced to Sofia, which it
captured, and then pushed on towards Philippopolis. At
Isladi near Ikhtiman, the beginning of the pass about
midway between Sofia and Philippopolis, Hunyadi found
that Murad had arranged for making a stand. The natural
strength of the pass, the principal entrance to which is the
Gate of Trajan, and the measures taken on the high tableland
at the head of this pass to make the frozen ground
impassable to cavalry, made Hunyadi hesitate. A second
pass appeared more practicable. On Christmas Eve, the
Christian army forced a passage, triumphing over the Turks
and over the equally serious obstacles of rocks and ice.
Murad’s strong entrenchments were carried by brilliant and
persistent attacks, the Christians having to make their way
through snowdrifts, while the enemy rolled rocks and
masses of ice from the heights. The Turks were driven
from their stronghold and the Christian army followed them
down the slopes of the Balkans into the plain. Once more
the Turks stood, and again they were beaten.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Upon this,
the triumphant Christian army halted and waited for
reinforcements before further advance.</p>

<p>It was probably immediately after this campaign, or
possibly during the halt in Roumelia, that Murad hastened
into Asia, where the prince of Caramania had engaged in a
conspiracy with others of the emirs of Anatolia to rise
against the sultan and to attack his territory simultaneously
with the attacks made by Christians in Europe. Konia and
many other cities had been sacked and desolation carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>far and wide even among the Turks wherever they had
stood for Murad.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> The sultan suppressed the rising with his
usual cruelty, treating the Turks as he had done the
Christians.</p>

<p>The successes of Hunyadi compelled Murad, and this for
several reasons, to sue for peace. He sent an embassy to the
Hungarian, but as the latter was awaiting new troops to pursue
his campaign, he at first declined to treat, and sent
Murad’s delegates to Szegedin, then occupied by the king
and the cardinal. Finding, however, that his reinforcements
did not arrive, Hunyadi consented to retire and take part in
the negotiations. The Turks on their side agreed to terms.
Murad was to give up to George Brankovitch all the places
in Serbia which he had captured, to allow Wallachia to be
added to Hungary, to leave Scanderbeg in possession of
Albania and Macedonia, and to give up the two lads whom he
had blinded and the other hostages. Ladislaus and Hunyadi
on the return of the latter to Hungary made a triumphal
entry into Buda. Thirteen pashas, nine Turkish standards,
and four thousand prisoners bore testimony to the success
of the campaign. The mission from Murad had gone forward
into Hungarian territory to complete the formalities
of peace which had been agreed to at Szegedin. A formal
<span class="sidenote">Peace solemnly accepted.</span>
truce for ten years was concluded in June 1444 between
Murad and the king of Poland and Hungary and his allies.
The treaty was not, however, signed by Hunyadi, who
declared that he was only a subject. Each party swore that
the army of his nation would not cross the Danube to attack
the other. Ladislaus took the oath to this effect solemnly
on the Gospels and Murad on the Koran.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>The treaty of June 1444 thus solemnly ratified was
almost immediately broken.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> To the eternal disgrace of

<span class="sidenote">Treaty violated by Christians.</span>
Ladislaus and of the cardinal legate, Julian Cesarini, who
had accompanied Hunyadi on the campaign just described,
and who figures as the evil genius of Ladislaus until his
death, it was broken by the Christians. History furnishes
few examples of equally bad faith.</p>

<p>All the evidence goes to prove that the Turks intended
to respect the treaty. The sultan, indeed, had taken the
opportunity of abdicating and of formally handing over the
government to his son, Mahomet, a boy fourteen years old,
and had already retired to Brousa with the intention of
going on to Magnesia, to live in peace and quietness.
Murad wanted rest. Even when he was seen by La
Brocquière, probably in 1436, he was ‘already very fat.’ A
short, thick-set man with a broad brown face, high cheekbones,
a large and hooked nose, he looked, says the same
writer, like a Tartar&mdash;that is, like a Mongol. Voluptuous in
the worst Turkish sense of the word, he also loved wine and
banished a believer who dared to reprove him for drinking
it. ‘He is thought,’ adds La Brocquière, ‘not to love war,
and this opinion seems to me well founded.’<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Just about
this time also he lost his eldest son, Aladdin, to whom he
was much attached, and was overcome with grief. Hence
his determination to get rid of the cares of government.</p>

<p>The opportunity to the Christians seemed tempting.
News had arrived that a powerful fleet of seventy ships had
appeared in the Bosporus, ten triremes having been sent
by the pope and ten others at his request by Latin princes.
The duke of Burgundy and a French cardinal had arrived
at Constantinople to urge John to join in a Christian league.
The cities of Thrace were undefended by the Turks, and the
fleets, it was believed, could prevent Murad with his army
from crossing into Europe. The only obstacle to vigorous
and successful action was the newly signed treaty.</p>

<p>Pretexts were found that Ladislaus had had no right to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>agree to a truce without the consent of the pope, and that
Murad had not executed his part of the treaty. Ladislaus
hesitated to break his oath, but Cardinal Julian urged that
his league with the Christian princes of the West was
better worth respecting than his oath to the miscreant.
According to more than one author, he maintained the proposition
that no faith need be kept with infidels.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> Finally,
the cardinal called down upon his own head all punishment
due to the sin, if sin there were, in violating the oath. But
in the name of the pope, the vicar of God on earth, he
formally released the king from the obligations to which he
had sworn.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>The action of Ladislaus was in reality not merely
wicked and immoral, but ill-advised and hasty. Even in
the short interval between the conclusion of peace and the
declaration of war, the French, Italian, and German
volunteers had gone home. John was not ready to aid
him. Phrantzes had been sent to Ladislaus, to the cardinal,
and even to the sultan, to temporise and to prevent an outbreak
of war before a coalition could be formed. Hunyadi
very reluctantly gave his consent to the violation of the
truce, and then only on condition that the declaration of war
should be postponed until September 1. George of Serbia
not only refused to violate the engagement into which he
had solemnly entered with Murad but refused to permit
Scanderbeg to join Ladislaus. The whole business was
ill-considered and ill-managed, and the fault lies mainly with
the cardinal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>When Murad’s dream of quiet days at Brousa was disturbed
by the news that the treaty solemnly accepted a few
weeks earlier had been violated by the faithless Christians,
who in this case are justly characterised by the Turks as
infidels, he at once resumed the duties of a ruler and prepared
to go to the aid of his son, young Mahomet. With
the aid of the Genoese he crossed the Bosporus, probably
at the extreme north end below the Giant’s Mountain,
where the entrance into the Black Sea was, and long continued
to be, known, from the number of temples which had
existed there from pre-Christian times, as the Sacred Mouth.
The Italian and Greek fleets near the capital were unable
successfully to resist the passage, the ascent of the Bosporus
being almost impossible for sailing vessels during
the continuance of the prevailing north winds. From
thence Murad hastened to meet the army of Ladislaus.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Varna, Nov. 11, 1444.</div>

<p>The place of rendezvous for the Christian armies was
Varna. Ladislaus took the field in the autumn, with only
ten thousand fighting men. He marched along the valley
of the Danube, and was joined by Drakul, prince of Wallachia,
with five thousand of his subjects. The total of the
two armies probably never exceeded twenty thousand men.</p>

<p>The Wallachian prince advised prudence and delay. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>pointed out that even a hunting party of the sultan contained
as many men as were now collected to oppose him.
Hunyadi, however reluctant he had been to enter on the
campaign, seems to have thought that, once the armies had
started, their only hope of safety lay in expedition and in
being able to obtain a strong position for fighting. The
discussion between the two brave leaders led to a quarrel, in
which Drakul drew his sword, but was immediately overpowered
and compelled to purchase safety by the promise
of a further reinforcement of four thousand men.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> Drakul
then retired, and his place was taken by his son. Many of
the towns and villages passed through on their march were
held by Turks, but the Christian armies, in most cases,
easily overcame all opposition, and in their course plundered
the schismatic Bulgarians and their churches as if they had
been enemies.</p>

<p>At Varna the army proposed to rest. Further advance,
if desirable, was difficult, on account of the illness of Ladislaus.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
Hunyadi took up a strong position.</p>

<p>Varna is at the head of a bay. On the south side was
situated, at a distance of about four miles from the town, a
village named Galata. Between the two stretched a long
line of marsh, which is the termination of a lagoon, bounded
on the south side by a steep range of hills.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Between the
end of the marsh and the bay the Christian army encamped
with the hill on its rear. Hardly had it taken up its
position when scouts brought the startling news that
Murad’s army was encamped at a distance of four thousand
paces. The night was bright and clear, and by ascending
the hill they could see the fires, and make even an estimate
of the number of their enemies. Their astonishment at the
rapidity with which Murad had advanced added to their
alarm. They found that he was at the head of an army of
at least sixty thousand men&mdash;a hundred thousand men are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>said to have crossed into Europe&mdash;while their own consisted
only of eighteen or twenty thousand. Guards were doubled,
and a council at once held, to decide upon what was to be
done. Cardinal Julian’s advice was that they should
entrench themselves, make a barrier around them of their
carts, and await attack. Their machines, or guns, the
alarming effect of which had already been seen at Belgrade,
would be of value for their defence. He also urged that
probably a fleet would soon come to their aid. The bishops
with the army, and a few others, agreed with him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Hunyadi and the leader of the
Wallachs declared the proposal to be absurd. The great
Hungarian urged that the enemy was only to be conquered
by daring and dash. Every sign of hesitation, especially at
the beginning of a campaign, was fatal. Suppose the
Turks also chose to play the waiting game, were the
Christians ready to stand a siege? Their only salvation lay
in audacity. He characterised what was said about the
coming of a fleet as ridiculous. Ships would be of no more
use in their present position than cavalry at sea. Even if
the sailors landed, what could they do against horsemen?</p>

<p>The advice of the experienced soldier carried the day.
The young king, though he was suffering great bodily pain,
supported Hunyadi, and declared against delay.</p>

<p>Hardly was the council of war over before the scouts
announced that the Turks had settled the question for
them and were preparing to attack. Though the alarm
was false, or at least premature, Hunyadi at once made all
arrangements for defence, and strengthened his position.
His army had its back to a hill; on one side was the marsh,
and on the other he placed his baggage and other wagons,
so as to make a rampart. He blocked up the passes
through the marsh as well as he could with carts and
chariots. He placed four companies of Wallachians on the
left, where the marshes afforded protection, while the Hungarians
formed the right wing, of which he himself took
command. This was the position of greatest danger, as
being least protected. Ladislaus was placed in the safest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
place in the centre, surrounded by Hungarians and Poles.
The great black standard of Hungary floated over Hunyadi,
while the flag of St. George marked the place near the king
occupied by the cardinal and the Wallachian chief. A
reserve of Wallachs was stationed to act wherever there was
necessity. Murad, however, did not begin his attack as
soon as the Christians expected. He took four days before
he completed his preparations. He came down further into
the plain, and carefully formed his plan of battle. The
invincible Janissaries occupied the centre, with the sultan
in their midst. They formed what may be called a zariba.
Around them was a ditch or trench. Behind that stood the
camels, while behind them was a breastwork formed of
shields fixed to the ground immediately in front of the
Janissaries surrounding the sultan. The Anatolian troops,
some of whom were armed with arquebuses, were on the
Sultan’s left, and the European or Rumelian troops on his
right. In front of the sultan, hoisted on a long spear, was
placed the violated treaty.</p>

<p>The Turks sent forward six thousand of their cavalry,
who occupied the hill near the Christian army. Their
purpose was to examine the ground, and to take note of the
numbers of the enemy, and of their position. Nevertheless,
they discharged showers of arrows against the Christians,
their archers being, as usual, their best troops.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> When
Franco, one of the standard-bearers of Ladislaus, prevented
his men from attacking them, the Turks, believing that the
Christians were overawed by their superior numbers and
dared not leave their entrenchments, came down into the
plain and began the battle. Then Franco let his troops go,
and with such effect that the Turkish cavalry were soon in
full retreat. Murad thereupon brought forward the main
body of his army, and the fight became general. Hunyadi
sustained successfully the shock of the Anatolian division,
drove it back and put it to rout. The remainder of the
Christian army in the plain were attacked at the same time,
but the Turkish horsemen were hard pressed, and fled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
One of the bishops who, says Callimachus, was more skilful
in ecclesiastical than in military matters, seeing the Turks
retreating, hastened after them with a band of soldiers, and,
arriving at the densely packed host, was soon floundering in
the marsh, and he and his men were of no further use in
the fight. But the Turks were pursuing their usual method
of fighting; ‘for,’ remarked La Brocquière only half a dozen
years before this battle, ‘it is in their flight that they are
most formidable, and it has been almost always then that
they have defeated the Christians.’<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>Meantime, Hunyadi, who knew their tactics well, on
returning from his fight with the Asiatic division, strictly
charged the young king not to allow the troops around him
to move, to remain with them, and to wait for his return
after attacking the European division, or at least until he
knew the issue of the fight, because, if successful, he would
then have to deal with the Janissaries.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> The Christians of
the left wing and even around the standard of Ladislaus
were hard pressed. The cardinal and Franco, with the son
of Drakul, had to fall back to the barricade of wagons. A
fierce struggle took place near and among the wagons, and
the Turks for a while gained ground. Hunyadi hastened to
the aid of the Christians, and his arrival changed for a while
the tide of battle. The Turks retreated from the wagons
and were driven back two thousand paces. Hunyadi and
his men were fighting splendidly and manifestly succeeding.
In their attack, Caradja, the leader of the European
division of the Turks, was killed.</p>

<p>At this moment occurred an incident which in all
probability influenced and perhaps altogether changed the
fortunes of the day. According to Chalcondylas, some who
were near the king and were jealous of the fame of Hunyadi
persuaded Ladislaus not to leave the glory of the day to the
Hungarian, as if he were the only leader. ‘His would be
the sole renown; ours the ignominy of having remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>idle.’ Influenced by these taunts, the king led his followers
into the fight while Hunyadi was attacking Murad’s right,
and made direct for the sultan himself in the midst of his
entrenchments. Hunyadi, who during the day was always
at the point of greatest danger, on galloping back after the
retreat of the Turks before the troops forming the left wing,
found that the brave but too impulsive young king had left
his post. Hunyadi immediately went to his aid. He found
that Ladislaus and his followers had broken through the
entrenchments, the line of camels and the shields, and were
among the Janissaries. Struggling desperately, he had laid
low many of the enemy, but had become separated from his
own men.</p>

<p>His absence caused many of the Christians to believe
that he had been either captured or killed and, in consequence,
many of them began to give way. The fortune of
the day was at this time doubtful. Many among the Turks
and Christians were in flight, neither party being able to
judge how the battle was going. The unconquerable
Janissaries, however, remained firm and resisted the young
king’s attack vigorously. In the crisis of the battle,
according to the Turkish annals, Murad prayed, ‘O Christ,
if Thou art God, as Thy followers say, punish their perfidy.’<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>Hunyadi was in despair. He saw his men deserting and
that his army had already been greatly reduced in numbers,
but he managed to reach the king. Ladislaus was still
fighting when his general drew near, but his horse fell
forward with him, in consequence of a great blow from an
axe. As the king fell, says Callimachus, he was instantly,
not merely pierced, but simply buried beneath the weapons
of the Janissaries. His head was taken to Murad, who had
it at once hoisted upon a lance.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>The issue of the battle had been at various stages doubtful.
Two divisions of the Turks had been beaten and fled,
but both had rallied and returned. At one moment the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>sultan himself contemplated flight, but was stopped by a
Turk who cursed him as a coward and prevented him from
leaving the field. Hunyadi attempted to recover the king’s
body, but when he saw one after another of the small
number of Wallachs who were with him struck down, he
looked to his own safety and made good his escape. The
battle was lost. He, Julian, Franco, and as many as could,
when darkness came on, retreated across the hills into the
great neighbouring forest.</p>

<p>The fortune of battle had so often changed that it was
not until the following day that the Turks recognised how
great was the success they had gained. The slaughter in
the small army of the Christians had been heavy. Many, too,
had perished in the marsh or had been drowned in the lagoon.
Others, among whom was Julian, were afterwards caught in
the forest. The remnant of Huns and Wallachs had the
utmost difficulty in making their way across the Danube.
On his way home, Hunyadi was taken prisoner by his old
enemy, Drakul, prince of Wallachia, but was set free when
the Hungarians threatened war, as they immediately did,
unless he was at once released.</p>

<p>The great effort from which the emperor and the West
had hoped so much had proved futile. The fleets had been
powerless. The struggle was over before aid was received
from the emperor or the Western princes. The remark of
a careful traveller is justified, that the bad faith of the
Christians did much to intensify among the Moslems
dislike and distrust, and led to reprisals commonly justified
by the Turkish teaching that ‘no faith is to be kept with
infidels.’<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>The part which the emperor John played, if he took any,
in this campaign, is doubtful. Chalcondylas states that he
had declared war against the sultan, but he is the only
contemporary who makes this assertion. Probably he was
ready, though unable, to aid the Western ships in preventing
Murad from crossing the Bosporus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>
<p>Murad had inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Christians,
was weary of fighting, and readily promised the emperor that,
if he abandoned all concerted action with the Western
powers, he should not be attacked. He once more abdicated
the throne in favour of his son Mahomet, and withdrew
to his beautiful gardens and palace at Magnesia,
hoping once more for peace in retirement.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>The same year&mdash;always 1444&mdash;he was forced by the
Janissaries, who were already beginning to claim a share in
the government, and who had marked their discontent by
burning a large part of Adrianople, to resume the guidance
of the state.</p>

<p>After reducing them to complete submission, he turned
his attention to Greece, which on the death of the previous
emperor had been divided between three of his seven sons.</p>

<p>Constantine, brother of John, and afterwards the last
emperor, had shown energy in the Morea. He was in
possession of a large part of the Peloponnesus, and had
chased the Turks out of Boeotia, Pindus, and part of
Thessaly. This weakening of their hold compelled Murad
to bestir himself. In November, 1446, he started for
Greece at the head of an army of sixty thousand men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Constantine sent an ambassador, the historian Chalcondylas,
to propose terms, which were, however, rejected. Murad
then advanced and attacked Constantine, who held a strong
position behind the famous rampart of the Hexamilion,
extending across the Isthmus of Corinth. Murad carried it
by assault, and killed all the garrison. His principal general
then ravaged the Morea, and carried off sixty thousand
Christians into slavery. Patras was captured and burnt,
and Constantine, who had fought well but whose army was
much smaller than the Turkish, had to pay tribute and
surrender all territory that he had conquered from the Turks
beyond the Isthmus of Corinth. He was still, however,
able to retain possession of a large part of the Morea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iskender Bey and the Albanians.</div>

<p>After the campaign in Greece, Murad marched northwards
to attack the Albanians, and endeavoured to capture
Kroya,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> the capital of the country. But it was held by the
Albanian leader, George Castriotes, whom we have already
met under the name of Iskender (or Alexander) Bey, a man
who was a military genius, and who in some respects recalls
the adventures and characteristics of Garibaldi. But he was
unscrupulous as well as energetic. Devoting himself like a
new Hannibal to the salvation of his country, he held and
continued to hold absolute, but willingly rendered, sway
during twenty-five years over the Albanian mountaineers.
Christian by birth, but given over with his brothers to the
Turks as hostages, and forcibly converted to Mahometanism,
he had become a favourite of Murad for his handsome
appearance, his strength of body, and his courage. He had
gained power over his countrymen in the first instance by a
ruse as bold as it was relentless. Scimitar in hand, he
offered as an alternative to the reis-effendi, or commander-in-chief,
either immediate death or the affixing of his signature
and seal to a document ordering the governor of Kroya
to hand over to him the fortress and the adjacent country.
Having obtained the document in due form, he then killed
the reis-effendi. At this time Iskender Bey was only nineteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>years old. Gathering a small band of Albanians about him,
he hastened across the peninsula and obtained possession of
Kroya by a stratagem even more desperate and dangerous
than that by which he had obtained the order for his appointment
as Turkish governor. Leaving his followers outside
the city and in hiding, he presented his credentials and
obtained the keys of the fortress. During the night, he
personally admitted his followers, and the Turkish garrison
were murdered while they slept. Then he rapidly made his
preparations for defence against the attack of Murad which
he knew would follow. It is sufficient for our purpose to
say that he was successful, and that at the approach of the
winter of 1447–8, Murad’s attempt to recapture Kroya
entirely failed, and the great sultan withdrew to Adrianople.</p>

<p>Meantime the Christians north of the Danube were preparing
to make a greater effort than ever to strike at the
power of the sultan. The new pope, Nicholas the Fifth,
urged the duty of aiding the Hungarians and the Poles as
vigorously as his predecessor. But his appeals to other
states were of little avail. Hunyadi, notwithstanding the
defeat at Varna, was named lieutenant-general of the kingdom
almost immediately on his return, and at once set
himself to reconstruct an army. In less than four years he
possessed the best-disciplined host which Hungary had yet
seen. But it was far too small for the purpose on hand.
Among its twenty-four thousand men were two thousand
German arquebusers and eight thousand Wallachians.
With this force Hunyadi crossed the Danube near Turn-severin
and invaded Serbia, because its ruler, whose sister was
married to the sultan, refused to break the engagement with
Murad.</p>

<p>When the sultan, who was preparing for another attempt
to defeat Iskender Bey and the Albanians, heard that George
of Serbia was on the point of being attacked, he at once
made all haste to go to his assistance. Hunyadi encamped
near Cossovo, on the same Plain of Blackbirds where, in
1389, Murad the First had been assassinated after his victory.
The Turkish army, probably numbering a hundred and fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
thousand men,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> occupied three days in crossing the Sitnitza,
a small river which runs through the plain into the Vardar.
Hunyadi, for some reason which is not evident, left his
entrenchment and crossed the stream, apparently with no
other object than of forcing on the fight. Why he should
have done so, since he was hourly expecting the arrival of a
detachment of Albanians under Iskender Bey, it is impossible
to understand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second battle of Cossovo-pol, 1448.</div>

<p>The battle commenced on October 18, 1448. The Turks
were drawn up in the same order as at Varna, the Janissaries
in the centre surrounded by a trench, behind which
were ranged the camels, and behind them again a belt of
shields or bucklers fixed in the ground. To the right of the
Janissaries was the European, and to the left the Asiatic,
division of Murad’s army. On the other side, the centre of
the Christian army was occupied by the German and Bohemian
arquebusers and some of the best troops of Transylvania.
The right wing was formed of Hungarians with a
few Sicilian auxiliaries, while the Wallachs were on the left.</p>

<p>The first day’s fight was not general. But at noon on
the second, the whole lines on both sides were engaged, and
continued till sunset, when, in spite of the superiority in
numbers on the Turkish side, no advantage had been gained.
Hunyadi, indeed, believed that during the night his enemy
intended to break up his camp and commence a retreat.
For this reason, he determined upon a night attack&mdash;one of
the measures, as General Skobeleff testified after fighting
in Central Asia under somewhat similar circumstances, in
which the best-disciplined army almost necessarily wins.
All the valour of the Hungarian army was powerless to
break through the line of the Janissaries, and the attack
consequently failed. On the morning of the third day, the
fight was again renewed, and victory appeared doubtful.
But the Wallachs turned traitors, and in the midst of the
fight, their leader having obtained terms from Murad, passed
over to the Turkish side. The army of Hunyadi was now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>attacked in front and rear, but contrived to reach its entrenchments.
Judging that its condition was hopeless,
Hunyadi made his escape in the evening, leaving the Germans
and Bohemians to hold the central position of his
encampment. This they did with magnificent courage, but
the battle was already lost. Out of the army of twenty-four
thousand, seventeen thousand men, including the flower of
the Hungarian nobility, are said to have been left dead on
the field.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> But the victory had been dearly bought by
Murad. During the three days’ fight, forty thousand Turks
had fallen.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>The Christians had lost the battle through the rash
courage and confidence of their leader. Hunyadi had refused
to wait for Iskender Bey and his Albanians, had abandoned
a strong position in order to attack an enemy largely superior
in numbers, and his desertion of the best of his auxiliaries is
inexplicable or unjustifiable. The defeat at Cossovo-pol,
following that at Varna, made men forget for a time the
series of brilliant victories which the great Hungarian had
gained over the Turks in Transylvania and elsewhere. But
in the glorious defence of Belgrade against Mahomet after
the capture of Constantinople, Hunyadi recovered greater
reputation than ever, and the West recognised in that city
the first bulwark of Christendom, and in its defender the
greatest soldier of the age.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>The effect in Hungary and Constantinople of these victories
of Murad was appalling. The sultan and his successors
for many years had nothing to fear from the enemy
north of the Danube.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons for failure of Western attempts against Turks.</div>

<p>The great combined efforts of the West to break the Ottoman
power and, incidentally, to save Constantinople had
failed disastrously. Nor are the reasons for such failure difficult
to understand. They are mainly two: underestimating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>the power of the enemy, and dividing their own forces.
First and above all, neither the pope nor the statesmen of
Europe had realised the enormous number of fighting men
which the Turk could bring into the field. They knew that
the empire of Constantinople had been dismembered by
Turkish armies, but they attributed this loss to secondary
causes, and do not appear to have realised that Turkish
armies beaten again and again constantly reappeared. The
empire’s loss, in their opinion, was due to the incapacity of
some of its emperors, to civil war, to the pressure of Serbia
and Bulgaria, and to the judgment of Heaven upon the
Greeks for having refused to come within the one Christian
fold, and to acknowledge the one shepherd. The Turks
were the instruments of divine justice to punish schismatics,
but, having done their work against the empire, they would,
now that they ventured to attack Catholic states, no longer
be permitted to make further encroachments.</p>

<p>The failure of the men of the West was largely due to the
fact that they despised the common enemy. They were
under the curious delusion that the Turk was not a fighting
man; that, though he had been successful in beating Greeks,
Serbs, and Bulgarians, he was no warrior, and that he had
thus far succeeded because he had never encountered
European soldiers. This delusion lasted for at least two
centuries after the capture of the city. Almost every
Western writer who visited Constantinople spoke of the
defeat of the Turks as a task well within the power of a
European state. That such a blunder influenced the men
of the West before the capture of the city, may be illustrated
by the statement of two contemporaries. In an oration by
Aeneas Sylvius, who afterwards became Pope Pius the Second,
delivered at Rome in 1452, before Pope Nicholas, King
Ladislaus, and a number of cardinals, the orator appealed to
the knowledge of his audience to recognise that the Turks
were ‘unwarlike, weak, effeminate, neither martial in spirit
nor in counsel; what they have taken may be recovered without
difficulty.’<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> A like testimony is given by La Brocquière
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>in 1438, but with much more caution, since he had been
through Asia Minor and had seen the Turks. Nevertheless,
this Western traveller states that, though he would not depreciate
them, he is ‘convinced that it would be no difficult
matter for troops well mounted and well led to defeat them,’
and, in regard to himself, he adds, ‘I declare that with one
half of their numbers I should never hesitate to attack
them.’<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> He fully realised, as he explains again and again,
that their victories had been gained by their enormous
superiority in numbers, but though he was very far from
despising them as soldiers, he regards them individually as
greatly inferior to the soldiers of Western states. His
estimate of the inferiority of the Turk was shared by his
countrymen and Western statesmen generally,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> but they did
not recognise to the same extent as he did how great and
ever increasing was the host which had to be fought. Nor
did they recognise, as did he, the wonderful mobility of the
Turkish army. It was the same error of forgetting their
mobility which brought disaster upon Hunyadi at Varna and
at Cossovo-pol.</p>

<p>While the first mistake was in underrating the might of
the enemy in regard to numbers, warlike spirit, and mobility,
the Western powers blundered also in dividing their forces.
The sermon before the pope already referred to, on New
Year’s Day 1452, called for international concerted action
to defend Constantinople, Cyprus, and Rhodes. The mistake
was in trying to do too much. On many occasions, as we
have seen, the forces sent against the Turk were divided,
and an army which might have been sufficiently strong to
strike an effective blow against one of the Turkish divisions
was defeated in detail when split into two or three, to be
sent against Saracens, or to the aid of the military knights,
as well as against the Turks.</p>

<p>The one chance of safety for Constantinople now lay in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>the inhabitants themselves, with such forces as, at the instigation
of the pope, should be sent to the aid of the emperor.
But to add to the chagrin and difficulties of the aged John
at seeing the Christian armies defeated, he had once more
formally to promise the sultan that he would not assist
any of the enterprises set on foot from the West. Nor
did the influence of the disasters upon the emperor and
people of Constantinople stop here. A formidable party in
the city, headed by the bishop of Ephesus, which was opposed
to the Union, and which strongly resented the proceedings
at the Council of Florence, was greatly strengthened. Its
members pointed to the victories of Murad, and asked, with
scorn, what had been gained by the abandonment of their
faith. They knew that they had the support of Murad in
their opposition to the Unionists, and the fact that they were
not forcibly suppressed by the Court party during the reign
of John’s successor can probably be best accounted for on
the ground that any strong steps taken against their members
would be represented to the sultan as a violation of
the engagement to have no further intrigues with the
West.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of John, October 1448.</div>

<p>The disaster of Cossovo-pol hastened the death of John,
which took place on the last day of October 1448, within a
few days after he had heard the news.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Murad, February 1451.</div>

<p>In February 1451, his great contemporary, Murad, died at
Adrianople. He had been a successful warrior, and, with the
exception of his failure to capture Belgrade, had succeeded
in most of his enterprises. Gibbon is perhaps justified in
speaking of him as a philosopher in matters of religion,
but he was relentless in imposing his creed. Cantemir, his
eulogist, relates that in Epirus he converted all the churches
into mosques, and ordered every male Epirot, under penalty
of death, to be forcibly made a Mahometan. He deserves the
praises of Turkish writers. Chalcondylas and Ducas recognise
in him certain good traits of character. The first says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>that he was a just and equitable man, and Ducas gives him
credit not undeserved for having scrupulously respected the
treaties which he made with Mahometans or Christians. His
son Mahomet, who now becomes the second sultan of that
name in the Ottoman dynasty, was at Magnesia when he
heard the news of his father’s death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the later Roman empire is now drawing to a close, it
is worth while endeavouring to realise what were the immediate
causes of its weakness, and what was its actual
condition immediately preceding the final siege.</p>

<p>The empire to which Constantine Dragases succeeded
on the death of his brother John was over the city and a
strip of land behind it which may be estimated roughly at about
a hundred miles in length from its walls towards the north
and west. To this and about half of the Peloponnesus still
held by his brother had the realm of Theodosius been
reduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How far was population demoralised?</div>

<p>It has often been stated that the fall of the Empire was
due to, or at least largely contributed to by, the demoralisation
of the Court, the nobles, and the citizens. This view had its
origin largely, though not exclusively, in the religious
animosity of Latin Churchmen. The Court has been
described as given over to gorgeous displays, to meaningless
ceremonies, to luxury, and to effeminacy; the nobles as
partakers in such displays and themselves effeminate; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
citizens as idle, delighting in spectacular shows, and asking
only to be amused. I know of no evidence which supports
any such conclusion and believe that, on the contrary, such
evidence as exists is against it. The population of the city,
nobles and people alike, were religious&mdash;given over to superstition,
according to our modern view&mdash;but they were not
luxurious or mere pleasure-seekers. Their superstition
corresponded with that of their fellow Christians in the
West. ‘I believe,’ says La Brocquière, who visited Constantinople
in 1433, ‘that God has spared the city more for
the holy relics it contains than anything else.’<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> But the
same writer adds the qualification that ‘the Greeks have not
the like devotion that we have for relics.’ Nor is this
religious or superstitious spirit the necessary companion of
either luxury or effeminacy. The effeminacy and the luxury
associated with Constantinople, in so far as they existed,
belong to the period before the Latin conquest. When any
displays are recorded after the recapture of the city&mdash;as,
for example, at coronations&mdash;they are merely the traditional
ceremonies which survived as such observances do in the
coronation of our own sovereigns or at great historical
courts like the Austrian and papal. The trials and sufferings,
the long struggles against external and internal enemies
which had gone on for nearly two centuries, had divested
nobles and people alike of any love for idle ceremonies or mere
diversions. The miracle plays which the people crowded to
see in Hagia Sophia do not show that they had degenerated.
The writer just quoted saw a representation of the three
youths cast by Nebuchadnezzar into the burning fiery
furnace,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> which, while it may have served to increase the
congregation’s trust in God, can hardly be regarded as a
frivolous amusement.</p>

<p>The hippodrome was no longer used by the people for
the shows which had pleased their ancestors at an early
period. La Brocquière, indeed, records that he saw the
emperor’s brother and a score of nobles amusing themselves
on horseback within its walls, but they were training them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>selves
for war by practising archery, and endeavouring to
make themselves masters in it.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> He records also that he
was present at a tournament which the emperor and empress
witnessed. Neither in his account nor in that of any contemporary
with which I am acquainted is there anything to
show that the diminished population of the city were other
than an industrious and sober people, to whom a question of
religious dogma was of greater interest than any other,
except perhaps those relating to the progress of their great
enemy.</p>

<p>But though the demoralisation of the Court and people
in the usual sense of the term ought not to be counted
among the reasons for the decay of the empire, the attitude
of mind in the Court, in the Church, and among the masses is
indicative of decay. In any country, but especially in one
under absolute monarchy, the poorer classes of the people
know and care little about politics. Among them there was
under the empire a general indifference as to what was likely
to happen. They were heavily taxed, were called upon to
send their sons to the wars, and if there were to be a change
of masters, it did not much matter. Their attitude was,
indeed, not unlike that which exists to-day among the poorer
Turks. A change of rulers would be welcomed by many,
perhaps by most, though at the last moment religious sentiment
might and probably would come in to rouse opposition.
Present evils are so burdensome that the hope of a change
of rulers is constantly expressed.</p>

<p>There was also among the subjects of the empire, as
among those of the sultan, an underlying sentiment that the
inevitable was happening. Ἀνάγκη ἦν was the belief among
the Greeks almost as firmly as the Turks of to-day hold that
it is their <i>kismet</i> to be driven out of Europe.</p>

<p>The poorer classes may be disregarded when we are considering
the public opinion of the empire. Such opinions
as existed among them were a reflection of those of the
nobles, and especially of the Churchmen. Both clergy and
nobles were intensely conservative, and had become by habit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>averse to any change. The energy had gone out of the
Church. There was no fervour of belief. The missionary
spirit was absolutely extinct. No instances are recorded of
abandonment of self-interest for the common good. The
great body of idle monks contrast unfavourably with those of
the West of the same period. The patriotism of the priest
Hilarion and his small following had not been imitated. A
dead level of contented mediocrity characterised the clergy.
An enthusiasm for Christianity, if it could not have saved
the empire, might at least have prolonged its existence.
But enthusiasm was dead. It would be a relief to read of
wild enthusiasts leading crowds into hopelessly impracticable
schemes, for such things would at least indicate life. Nothing
of the kind exists. The life of the Church was suspended, and
it could only arouse itself to resist change. Even in the
greatest religious question of the two centuries preceding
1453, that of the Union of the Churches, the Orthodox
Church had to be stimulated into action by the emperors
and nobles.</p>

<p>The nobles themselves were, however, hardly less conservative
than the Churchmen. A lack of energy, an absence
of vital force, is the distinguishing characteristic of both.
Until the Latin conquest, their conservatism was that of a
civilised and wealthy class, who had enjoyed for centuries
the advantages of peace and of security. In the two centuries
after the recovery of the city the nobles had regained
much of their old influence, and up to the final conquest
felt, in Constantinople, much of the same security as before
and the contentment of acquired or inherited wealth. Commerce
had largely passed into the hands of the Genoese and
Venetians, but the loss hardly affected the nobles. To all
appearance they remained as contented as ever. Even in
presence of the enemy which had constantly been lessening
their incomes and drawing an iron circle around the empire,
they appear to have been hardly conscious of the life and
death character of the struggle.</p>

<p>So long as the emperor and nobles could employ their
own peasantry or could hire auxiliaries, they had resisted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Turks with a certain amount of success. From Dalmatia
to Matapan, from Durazzo to the capital, as well as in Asia
Minor, the progress of the enemy had been contested. The
Greek armies were destroyed by overwhelming numbers rather
than defeated by superior courage. When the capital was
cut off from its supply of soldiers from the provinces, it was
in grievous straits, and to this condition it had come on the
accession of the last Constantine.</p>

<p>Priests and nobles appear to have gradually drifted into
the belief that resistance was hopeless. Their acquiescence
in what they believed to be the inevitable suggests the
mediocrity of their leaders. Their merits and faults were
alike negative. They were not given over to vice and
profligacy; they were not cruel tyrants; they were not wanting
in courage; but they were without ability or energy,
incapable of initiating or executing any successful plan of
campaign against the enemy or of making arrangements for
securing efficient foreign aid.</p>

<p>It is, of course, easy to suggest after the event that the
empire might have been saved, but it is difficult to believe
that among the governing class there was not a lack of
vitality which contributed to its fall. Looking across the
centuries, we may, perhaps, conclude that the empire followed
the natural course of evolution under despotic rule: struggle
for existence, success, wealth, contentment to the point of
stagnation, a general slackness and loss of energy and a
reluctance to struggle of any kind. But whether such
conclusion be justified or not, it cannot be doubted that
weariness of strife and general enervation characterised all
classes of society. In remembering this, it may be said that
the morale of the empire was destroyed and its population
demoralised.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>Three causes mainly contributed to the diminution and
ultimate downfall of the empire: first, the establishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Causes of decay of empire.</span>
of the Latin empire, with which must be associated (<i>a</i>) the
internal dissensions among the Greeks themselves, and (<i>b</i>)
the increased difficulty in assimilating the races occupying
the Balkan peninsula; second, the attacks, literally from
every side, by hordes of Turkish invaders, who usually, beginning
by raids upon their cattle, ended by expelling or exterminating
the conquered people and taking possession of their
lands; and, third, the depopulation of the Balkan peninsula
and of the cities in Asia Minor held by the empire caused by
Black Death or Plague.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Latin conquest.</div>

<p>The history of the empire subsequent to the Latin occupation
bears evidence of the weakness which that occupation
had caused. The whole framework of government administration
had been broken up. The imperial system was in
ruins. The ancient forms of administrative organisation
were restored, but there never existed sufficient strength
in the capital to put new life into them, and the old
traditional spirit of municipal life and to a certain limited
extent of self-government had during two generations of
hostile rule and the subsequent series of attempts at the
restoration of Latin rule been forgotten. The empire was,
indeed, kept together by obedience to law, but it was
rather a traditional obedience than one due to a strong
administration. When a man defied law it was public
opinion which he had to face rather than dread of the
emperor. The Latin conquest and the growth of neighbouring
states consequent upon such conquest made it impossible
for the emperors ever to obtain a strong and sufficient hold
over the territories which they recaptured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Internal divisions.</div>

<p>The divisions among the Greeks themselves, especially
those regarding the occupancy of the throne, led to civil wars
and gave the Turks opportunities of entering the country
and occupying it. They were due in the first place to the
change in the succession when Michael the Eighth seized the
imperial throne, and were therefore also directly caused or
contributed to by the Latin conquest. Though the rules
of succession had never been so strictly observed as in the
West, his usurpation weakened the office of emperor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
manifestly increased the power&mdash;not of a regularly constituted
body like our House of Lords, or the American
Senate, but&mdash;of an irresponsible body of nobles. In the next
place, the dissensions may be attributed to the existing and
traditional form of government.</p>

<p>It is a commonplace to say that uncontrolled autocracy
is the best government if a succession of able men can be
assured. The difficulty is that, if the ordinary rules of
succession are observed, the successor of a Justinian or a
Julius Caesar may be a fool. In Constantinople effective
control over the appointment of an emperor was wanting.
The senate or council of an absolute ruler, be he called emperor
or sultan, is usually weak in proportion to the strength of
the ruler, and if, in the customary order of succession, the
heir to the throne is unsuited to the office, the ring of
creatures, by whatever name it is called, which his predecessor
has gathered round him is pretty sure to support the heir,
irrespective of his merit or ability. Others acquiesce for the
sake of peace, or are drawn to support a pretender. The
nobles usually gained strength during the reign of a weak
prince, and in the support they gave to rival claimants the
empire bled.</p>

<p>Democratic government in the modern sense of the term
had not yet been born. Sir Henry Maine claims that the
modern doctrines of popular government based on democracy
are essentially of late English origin. It is certain that
nothing like them had existed in the Roman empire, either
in the East or West. Any traditions of self-government
which the Greeks had retained&mdash;a form of self-government
which was never upon modern democratic lines&mdash;had been
entirely overshadowed, not merely by the autocratic government
of the emperors, but by that of the Church. The
government was that of an absolute sovereign moderated by
irresponsible nobles.</p>

<p>Without, however, seeking further to discover the reasons
for the internal divisions and the consequent civil wars,
their existence and baneful effects are the most manifest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
though not the most important, of the evils which weakened
the Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divisions of race in Balkan peninsula.</div>

<p>The second fact associated with the mischief caused by
the Latin conquest, which contributed to the decay of the
empire, is that such conquest prevented the assimilation
of the various peoples occupying the Balkan peninsula.
Even at the best period of the empire that population had
always been strangely diversified. Albanians and Slavs had
been there from very early times, side by side with Greeks
and the race known as Wallachs, each of the four races
having a distinct language.</p>

<p>The influence of good administration and the strong hand
of the central power kept these races in order. They had
the usual tendency to hostility one towards the other, but
until the Latin conquest good government and the Greek
language, that of the Church and administration, were always
a force tending to break down the boundaries between them
and to incorporate isolated sections in the Greek-speaking
community. But at all times their mutual jealousies
constituted, as indeed they do now, the most difficult factor
in the problem of the government of the Balkan peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>This difficulty had been enormously increased by the Latin
conquest. The populations were harassed everywhere by
native rebellions and by foreign invaders: Greek pretenders
to the empire who refused to recognise the crusading kings:
crusading knights who settled in Greece after the expulsion
of Baldwin: adventurous soldiers of fortune from Italy:
freebooters from the Catalan Grand Company: Venetians
and Turks: and lastly by dissensions between the emperors
themselves, the most hurtful of which were between Cantacuzenus
and John.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>
<p>The various invaders found their task easier from the
hostility which existed between the various groups. Racial
animosity was fostered by inducements held out by the newcomers
to one group to join them in attacking another.
These troubles destroyed the work of assimilation which
had been going on for centuries. Communities now of
Greeks, now of Slavs, were driven from the localities they had
occupied for long periods, and the constant movement left
the Balkan peninsula with its various races intermingled in
strange confusion. To adopt chemical nomenclature, hundreds
of villages were mechanically mixed with those of other
races but never chemically combined. There were Slav
villages in the neighbourhood of Athens itself, Albanians in
Macedonia: Greeks, Serbians, and Bulgarians largely replaced
the Latin race of that province, which in the times of the
Crusades was known as Wallachia Proper. Language and
race had taken the place of subjection to the empire as a
bond of union, and as the Turks gradually pressed forward
their advances into the interior, literally from every side, they
found the conquest of these isolated and generally hostile
communities greatly facilitated by the disunion existing
among them.</p>

<p>Throughout Macedonia, Thessaly, Epirus, and Greece the
boundaries were changed oftener even than allegiance, and
though the Greek element predominated in the south and
along the coast as far as Salonica and around the coasts of
the Aegean and the Marmora, other communities were interspersed
among them in great numbers.</p>

<p>The subjugation of the Macedonian Serbs and the South
Bulgarians can be roughly stated as having been accomplished
at the battle on the Maritza. The defeat of the Serbians
and Bulgarians was a harder task. But Serbia and Bulgaria
were the two portions of the Balkan peninsula where the
people were almost all of the same race and could organise
themselves for defence. No such organisation was possible
south of their territory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">System of Turkish conquests.</div>

<p>The second cause which had contributed to the diminution
of the empire and of its population was the system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Turkish conquests. Large numbers of the Christian population
were killed; larger numbers were driven away to wander
houseless and homeless and either to die of starvation or find
their way into the towns.</p>

<p>Conquest of a territory or capture of a city, forcible
expulsion of the inhabitants or massacre of most of them
and occupation of the captured places followed each other
with wearisome regularity. The military occupation was
that of nomads who replaced agriculturists. Everywhere
the cattle of the Christians were raided. Arable lands became
the wasteful sheep-walks of nomad Turks.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Black Death.</div>

<p>Lastly, the depopulation caused by the terrible diseases
which visited Europe in the century preceding the Moslem
conquest aided greatly in destroying the empire. The prevalence
of Black Death or Plague killed in the Balkan
peninsula and especially in the towns hundreds of thousands
and possibly millions of the population. In 1347
this scourge, probably the most deadly form of epidemic
that has ever afflicted humanity, made its appearance in
Eastern Europe. The cities of the empire contained large
populations crowded together, and their normal population
was increased by many fugitives. These crowded cities, with
their defective sanitary arrangements and poverty-stricken
inhabitants, offered a favourable soil for a rich harvest of
death. The disease had followed the coasts from the Black
Sea, where, says Cantacuzenus, it had carried off nearly all
the inhabitants. At Constantinople it raged during two
years, one of its first victims being the eldest son of Cantacuzenus
himself.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Rich as well as poor succumbed to it.
What proportion of the inhabitants of the city died it is impossible
to say, but, judging by what is known of its effect
elsewhere, we should probably not be wrong in suggesting
that half the people perished. But its ravages were not confined
to the towns, and from one end of the Balkan peninsula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>to the other it swept the country in repeated visitations and
probably carried off nearly the same proportion of inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
Cantacuzenus, in a vivid description of the disease, adds that
the saddest feature about it was the feeling of hopelessness
and despair which it left behind.</p>

<p>The first visitation of the disease continued during two
years in the capital. In 1348 it spread throughout the
empire. We have seen that in 1352 the victorious Venetian
and Spanish fleets dared not venture to attack Galata for
fear that their crews would be attacked by the malady. It
raged in Asia Minor as fiercely as in Europe. Trebizond
was ruined. The Turks themselves suffered severely. Between
its entrance into Europe and 1364 the Morea had
three visitations, and what remained of the Greek population
became panic-stricken. Further north, at Yanina its ravages
were equally terrible. In 1368 so many men died that
Thomas, governor of the city, forced their widows to marry
Serbians whom he had induced or compelled to enter
the city for that purpose. A further outbreak seven years
later took place in the same city, and among its victims was
Thomas’s own daughter. During the same period Arta,
which adjoins the ancient Cyzicus, suffered severely. It is
useless for our purpose to inquire whether Black Death
and Plague were identical, but one or the other continued
to depopulate town and country. We have seen it at
Ferrara in 1438, but in the interval since it first made
its appearance it had visited the capital on seven different
occasions, the latest being in 1431 when the whole country
from Constantinople to Cape Matapan suffered severely.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>It may safely be assumed that the Turks, who lived in
the open air, and in the country rather than in towns, suffered
less than the Christians. Though they are reported to
have lost severely, the process of depopulation scarcely told
against them. The places of those who died were taken by
the ever-crowding press of immigrants flocking westward.
The successors of the Greeks who perished were not Christians
but Turks. In other words, while the Christians died out of
the land, there were always at hand Turkish nomads to take
their place.</p>

<p>It is when contemplating the devastation produced by
successive attacks of disease, one of which was sufficient to
kill half the population of England, when remembering the
weakening of the empire by the Latin occupation and the
subsequent attempts to recapture the city, and when recognizing
that the empire was the bulwark against a great
westward movement of the central Asiatic races which
forced forward the Turk to find new pastures in Christian
lands, that we can understand how the diminution of the
Empire and of its population and its ultimate downfall came
to be inevitable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Desolation on accession of last empire and now.</div>

<p>Those who have travelled most in the Balkan peninsula
and in Asia Minor recognise most completely how densely
populated and flourishing these countries once were, and
how completely they have become a desolation. Everywhere
the traveller is even now surprised at the sight of deserted
and fertile plains and of ruined cities, of some of which
the very names have been forgotten. From Baalbek to
Nicomedia the ancient roads pass through or near places
whose names recall populous and civilised towns which
are but the ghastly shadows of their former prosperity.
Ephesus, which when visited by Sir John Maundeville in
1322, after it had been captured by the Turks, was still ‘a
fair city,’ is now absolutely deserted. Nicaea, the city which
has given its name to the Creed of Christendom, was also at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>the time of the Turkish occupation populous and flourishing.
It now contains a hundred miserable houses within
its still standing walls. Hierapolis and Laodicea are heaps
of uninhabited ruins. A scholarly English traveller remarks
that his search has been in vain for the sites of many cities
once well known, and that he met ruins of many cities which
he was unable to identify.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> The same story of depopulation
and of destruction was and is told by the condition of the
Balkan peninsula. The observant traveller La Brocquière,
who made his journey through Asia Minor to Constantinople
and thence to Budapest, noted that desolation was everywhere.
In the district between the capital and Adrianople
he adds that ‘the country is completely ruined, has but poor
villages, and, though good and well watered, is thinly peopled.’
He found Chorlou ‘destroyed by the Turks.’ He visited
Trajanopolis and describes it as once ‘very large, but now
nothing is seen but ruins with a few inhabitants.’ He
found Vyra, to whose church three hundred canons had
been formerly attached, a poor place with the choir of the
church only remaining and used as a Turkish mosque.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> All
contemporaries bear witness to the depopulation and ruin
of the country. From pestilence and the results of the Latin
conquest it might have recovered, but when to these disasters
was added that of conquest by successive hordes of barbarians
whose work was always destructive, its ruin was complete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Population of Constantinople on accession of Constantine.</div>

<p class="tb">It is impossible to arrive at an accurate estimate of
the population of the city on the accession of the last
Constantine. La Brocquière, in 1433, describes Constantinople
as formed of separate parts and containing open
spaces of a greater extent than those built on.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> This is
one of many intimations that the population had largely
decreased.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> Some of the nobles as well as the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>people had left the city as soon as they saw that a siege was
probable.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> To make an estimate we must anticipate our
narrative of the siege. Critobulus makes Mahomet appeal
to the knowledge of his hearers in proposing to besiege the
city when he states that the greater number of the inhabitants
have abandoned it; that it is now only a city in name
and contains tilled lands, trees, vineyards, and enclosures as
well as ruined and destroyed houses, as they have all seen
for themselves. As his hearers could see as well as he
whether this statement was correct, there can be little doubt
of its accuracy. He further declared that there were few
men in the city and that these for the most part were without
arms and unused to fighting, and that he had learned from
deserters that there were only two or three men to defend
each tower, so that each man had to guard three or four
crenellations. Tetaldi states that there were in the city from
twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand men<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> and six to seven
thousand combatants and not more.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> The actual census
taken at the request of the emperor and recorded by Phrantzes
gives under five thousand fighting men, exclusive of foreigners.
Assuming the statement of the French soldier and eye-witness
Tetaldi to be substantially correct, there would apparently
be something like eighteen thousand monks and old men
incapable of bearing arms. The only other indications
which assist in forming an estimate of the population are
furnished by the number of prisoners. These are probably
exaggerated. Archbishop Leonard estimates them at
above sixty thousand. Critobulus gives the number of
slaves of all kinds, men, women, and children, as fifty
thousand citizens and five hundred soldiers, estimating that
during the siege and capture four thousand were killed.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>
Probably all captives are included as having been reduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>to slavery. The complete desolation of the city and the
strenuous efforts made by the sultan to repeople it after the
capture raise a strong presumption in favour of the existence
of a comparatively small population at the time of the siege.
Gibbon judged that ‘in her last decay Constantinople was
still peopled with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants,’
forming his estimate mainly upon the declaration of the
archbishop as to prisoners. I am myself disposed to think
that this number is rather over- than under-estimated. Taking
the prisoners to be fifty thousand, and allowing for
the escape of ten thousand persons and another ten thousand
for old men and women who were not worth reducing
to slavery, probably eighty thousand would be about right.</p>

<p>Within the narrow limits of what had been possible, the
citizens over whom the new emperor was called to rule had
done their duty to the city itself. They had kept fourteen
miles of walls the most formidable in Europe in good repair
and they had preserved the wonderful aqueducts, the cisterns,
the great baths and churches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its commerce.</div>

<p>Commerce still continued to be the principal support of
the inhabitants. This was now largely shared by the
Genoese in Galata and by the Venetians who occupied a
quarter in Constantinople itself. The familiarity of the
Italian colonists with Western lands and their superiority in
shipping, in which indeed at this time they led the world,
enabled them to achieve a success in what was then long-voyage
travelling which was denied to the Greeks; but the
latter collected merchandise from the Black Sea ports and
from the Azof which was either sold to the Frank merchants
in Constantinople or transhipped on board their vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emperor and nobles.</div>

<p>It is difficult to realise what were the relations between
the government and the governed during the two centuries
before the last catastrophe. The empire was the continuator
of the autocratic&mdash;or rather the aristocratic&mdash;form of
government which had been derived from the elder
Rome. Emperor and nobles governed the country. The
nobles formed the senate. Like our own Privy Council, it
met rarely and had ill-defined functions, but upon occasions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
emergency it had to be consulted. Its co-operation gave to
any measures edicted by the emperor an important sanction.
When the decision of the senate was acquiesced in by or
coincided with that of the Patriarch and his ecclesiastical
council, the emperor may be said to have possessed all the
approval that could be derived from public opinion.</p>

<p>Though the senate met rarely, its support was never
altogether dispensed with. The emperors did not claim to
reign by divine right, nor was any such pretext put forward
on their behalf. The succession passed in the usual manner
and the emperor reigned with almost autocratic powers so
long as the nobles and the patriarch and ecclesiastics were
content. In the period with which we are concerned the
nobles sometimes preferred to associate a younger man with
the occupant of the throne. Such association was usually,
though not always, in accordance with the desire of the
reigning emperor, and had the conspicuous advantage of
allowing the elder to train his younger associate in statecraft.
In some cases, as in those of young Andronicus and
of John during the reign of his father, Manuel, it was imposed
upon the emperor in order to bring about a change of policy.</p>

<p>No form of popular representation existed. The mass of
the people had nothing to do with the laws except to obey
them. So long as their lives and their property were
protected and the laws fairly administered they were
content.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Administration of law.</div>

<p>So far as can be judged from the silence as well as from
the writings of the Byzantine writers, there was little fault
to find with the administration of law. When cases of
the miscarriage of justice are mentioned they are generally
brought forward to show the scandal they had produced or
in some other connection which suggests that such cases
were exceptional. It was not only that the keen subtlety
of a long succession of Greek-speaking lawyers had preserved
the traditions of their great ancestors of the time of
Justinian and had guarded law in admirable forms, but the
still better traditions of an honest administration of law
had continued, and this with the result&mdash;simple as it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
appear to Western readers; strange as it would have
sounded to a Turkish subject at any time since the capture
of Constantinople&mdash;that people believed that the decisions of
the law courts were fairly given.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interest in religious questions.</div>

<p>The inhabitants of the capital retained until the last days
of its history as a Christian city their intense interest in
religious questions. It is of less importance to qualify such
interest as superstitious or fanatical than to try to understand
it. That theological questions possessed a dominating
influence over the people of Constantinople is one of the
facts of history, and represents an important element in the
education of the modern Western world.</p>

<p>An able modern writer says with justice that ‘religious
sentiment was down to the fall of the empire as deep
as it was powerful. It took the place of everything
else.’<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> Probably the exclusion of the great bulk of the
inhabitants from all participation in government and the
consequent want of general interest in political questions or
those regarding social legislation helped to concentrate
attention upon those relating to religion. The Greek
intellect&mdash;and, though there were large sections of the population
which were not Greek, the Greek element as well as the
Greek language gave its tone to all the rest&mdash;was essentially
active and philosophical. The investigation of theological
questions was not conducted lightly. The same spirit
which made scholars of Constantinople espouse the study of
Plato as they had done for two centuries before 1453&mdash;a
study which caused Pletho, on his visit with John at the
Council of Florence, to be regarded as an authority to be
eagerly sought after by those awakening to the new learning
in Italy&mdash;had been applied to many questions of philosophy
and theology. The examination of such questions was
more speculative, thorough, and scientific than in the
West.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>While it is true that Constantinople had for centuries
produced few ideas and little of original value in literature, it
had rendered great service to humanity by preserving the
Greek classics. Its methods of thought, its civilisation as
well as its literature, were on the model of classical antiquity,
but these were all modified by Christianity. Part of the
mission of the empire had been to save during upwards of
a thousand years, amid the irruptions of Goths, Huns and
Vandals, Persians and Arabs, Slavs and Turks, the traditions
and the literary works of Greece. It had done this part of its
work well. Amid the obscurity of the Middle Ages in the
West, Constantinople had always possessed writers who
threw light on the history of the empire in the East. No
European people, remarks a recent writer, possesses an
historical literature as rich as do the Greeks. From
Herodotus to Chalcondylas the chain is not broken.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> The
Greek historians of the period with which the present work
is concerned, Pachymer, Cantacuzenus, Gregoras, Ducas,
Critobulus, and Phrantzes are in literary merit far superior
to the contemporary chroniclers of the West. Though
their works are written in a style which aims at reproducing
classical Greek and imitating classical models, they were not
intended merely for Churchmen. Nor was Constantinople
rich only in historians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civilisation not modern.</div>

<p>Though intellectual life was never wanting in the city,
many of whose people possessed the quick, ingenious, and piercing
intellect of the Greek race, the reader of the later historians
feels that the civilisation amid which they lived was not
that of modern times. It is difficult to realise what it was like.
It has often been compared with that of Russia, and writers
of reputation have spoken of that empire as preserving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>succession of the political and religious systems of Byzantium
as well as of its mission to the non-civilised nations of
Asia.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Allowing for the difference between the Greek and
the Slav intellect, the analogy in a general sense holds
fairly good, and is especially noticeable in two points, the
religious spirit of both peoples and their contented exclusion
from all active participation in the government.</p>

<p>It is, however, difficult to determine how far the conditions
of existence in the first half of the fifteenth century
among the citizens of the capital resembled those found in
Russia. The difficulty arises, not merely from distance of
time, but from the fact that in the empire manners, usages,
the conception of life, and the influence of religion were
neither Western nor modern. The people were governed
much as Russia is governed now: but there were important
differences due to race, tradition, and environment. Nevertheless,
the condition of the empire reminds one of the Russia
of fifty years ago. There were the same great distances between
the capital and the provinces and the same difficulty
of communication. News travelled slowly; public opinion
hardly existed. There were in the country a mass of ignorant
peasants tilling the ground and caring little for anything else,
peasants who were in a condition of serfdom, thinking of
the emperor as a demi-god and rendering unquestioning
obedience to his representatives; thinking of the Church as
a divine institution entrusted with miraculous powers to
confer a life after death, but far too ignorant to trouble
themselves about heresies or dogmas. Among these
peasants probably only the priests and monks were able to
read, although among a people naturally intelligent this
would not necessarily imply a want of interest in what was
going on around them. The analogy to Russia must not be
pushed too far. Religion and language, a common form of
Christianity and the traditional duty of submission to the
rule of Constantinople were the bonds which held the
empire together, but the Greek tendency to individualism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>and the political development of the empire which destroyed
the belief that allegiance was necessarily due to the ruler in
the capital had been for two centuries a disintegrating element
which prevented the growth of the apathy on political
and social questions, and the deadly contentment which has
been a characteristic of the great Slavic race.</p>

<p>In the cities there was intellectual life: Salonica, Nicaea,
Smyrna, and other centres of population had in times past
vied with the capital in general culture and still retained
something of their attachment to it. To the last hour of
the empire there was, as we have seen, general and absorbing
interest in the question of the Union of the Churches.
But interest in other questions which had once kept religious
thought from stagnation had largely died out. The more
pressing questions of life interested the citizens. Moreover,
the people believed that all questions of Christian belief had
been settled. The Creed was final and had no more need
of revision than the style of the Parthenon. The practices
adopted from Paganism had become so generally accepted
as to pass without dispute. Iconoclasts and Paulicians can
hardly be said to have left any representatives. A Pagan
Christianity with a Pantheism accepting holy springs, miraculous
pictures, miracle-working relics, had become the
accepted form of faith, a form which we of the twentieth
century find it as difficult to understand as the earlier belief
which had regarded the emperor as divinity.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties of the student of political and
social history of the thirteenth and two following centuries
is that of being unable to get glimpses of personal characteristics
or domestic life. The men who figure in contemporary
writings are too often little better than dummies who move and
turn, but do not suggest vitality. An historical novel of the
period written upon the lines of Scott or Dumas, of Kingsley
or Charles Reade, or better still, anything corresponding to
Chaucer’s ‘Canterbury Tales,’ would be of priceless value in
giving indications not merely of what was the environment
of a Constantinopolitan but of the characteristics of an
individual of the period. The writers on whom we have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
depend are mostly Churchmen, who describe the persons of
whom they write as if they felt bound to make them correspond
with one of half a dozen approved models.</p>

<p>The absence of better indications may be accounted for.
The subjects of the empire during the century and a half
preceding 1453 lived in the midst of alarms. Its boundaries
had been constantly changing and continually narrowing.
Disaster followed disaster; usurpations, dynastic struggles,
inroads of Genoese and Venetians; struggles with them and
between them; ever encroaching Turks, battles, triumphs,
defeats, hopes of final success, but territory still decreasing;
hope of aid from the West or from Tamerlane; illusions all:
finally the last siege and extinction. The writers in the
midst of such times thought they had more important
matter to deal with than the depiction of scenes of domestic
character or delineations of prominent persons.</p>

FROM THE WEST; EMPEROR MEETS WITH LITTLE
SUCCESS; ARRIVAL OF CARDINAL ISIDORE; RECONCILIATION
SERVICE DECEMBER 12, 1452, IN HAGIA SOPHIA;
DISSENSIONS REGARDING IT.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> emperor John left no son, and the succession had therefore
to pass to one of his three brothers, Constantine,
Demetrius, and Thomas. Constantine, the eldest, was at the
time of the emperor’s death at Sparta, but Demetrius claimed
that as his elder brother was not born in the purple, while
he had inherited that honour, the crown ought to be placed
on his head. The dowager empress, the widow of Manuel,
the clergy, senate, the troops and people generally, declared
in favour of Constantine.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>While the matter was still under debate, Thomas, who had
learned at Gallipoli the death of his brother, arrived in the
capital and immediately supported the nomination of
Constantine. An embassy was sent to the Morea and on
January 6, 1449, placed the crown on the head of Constantine
Dragases, the last Christian emperor of Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>On March 12, he arrived in the capital and his brother
Thomas, who had been appointed despot, went after some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>days to the Morea. There he was shortly afterwards joined
by Demetrius who had withdrawn his opposition and
accepted the situation.</p>

<p>The party opposed to the Union had now become
sufficiently strong to call together a Synod, which met in
the autumn of 1450. The three patriarchs of the East were
present, and under their guidance the assembly declared the
patriarch Gregory to be an enemy of the Orthodox Church
and deposed him. In his stead they appointed Athanasius.</p>

<p>During the interval between the death of John and that
of Murad, on February 3, 1451, the Christian cause looked
more hopeful. Scanderbeg had maintained himself successfully
in the field, Murad had been compelled a second
time to raise the siege of Croya. In four separate battles
the Turkish armies had been defeated. In the siege of
Sventigrad they lost thirty thousand men, and, though
the brave Albanian failed in capturing the city and had to
raise the siege, his campaign was a triumph.</p>

<p>It seems to have been generally recognised that young
Mahomet, the successor of Murad, had even before his
accession determined to lay siege to the city. The emperor,
therefore, once more renewed the efforts of his predecessors
to obtain foreign aid. Once more the insuperable obstacle
to the Union of the Churches, the rigid refusal of clergy and
people, came to the fore. Constantine, like his predecessors,
tried and failed to coerce the Church. Athanasius, the new
patriarch, declared himself ready to maintain the Orthodox
faith and declined to recognise the acts of the Council of
Florence. When Constantine asked aid from Rome, he
found that the deposed Gregory had taken refuge there, and
while the patriotism of the latter led him to seek the
pontiff’s help against the Turks, his Catholicism compelled
the pope to espouse his cause. Nicholas the Fifth summoned
the emperor, as the price of his support, to replace
Gregory and to take the measures necessary for formally
completing the Union agreed to at Florence. Constantine
was willing to do what he could, but knew the temper of his
subjects. He knew himself to be distrusted by them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
what they regarded as his Romanising tendencies. When
Mahomet was at Magnesia, where the news of the death of
his father reached him, the Christians around regarded the
new emperor unfavourably on account of his predilection for
the Union, and spoke of him as a usurper. Constantine, who
was on the look out for a wife<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> and had employed Phrantzes
on various expeditions to find one, had been compelled, on
account of the opposition of his subjects to any further
relationship with the Latins, to abandon his intention of
marrying the daughter of Foscari, the doge of Venice. He
had thus given offence to a powerful state, and, though he
had offered all sorts of concessions, Venice would only promise
to send ten galleys to the help of the city.</p>

<p>The emperor temporised. He begged the pope to send
ships and also learned and capable ecclesiastics who could
aid him to make the Union acceptable to the clergy. In
reply Nicholas promised to send a fleet, although he was
powerless to persuade other Christian princes to follow his
example. In answer to his second request he deputed
Cardinal Isidore, Metropolitan of Russia, whom we have
seen at the Council of Florence, to be his legate.</p>

<p>In November 1452, a great Genoese ship with the
cardinal accompanied by Leonard, archbishop of Chios,
arrived at the city and was received by the emperor with
every honour. Isidore at once pressed for a formal recognition
of Union. The emperor and some of the nobles
assented, but the majority of the priests, monks, and nuns
refused. Ducas says that no nun consented and that the
emperor only pretended to do so. It is not unlikely that he is
right. Mahomet had declared war. Preparations for the siege
of Constantinople were already being made, and not only the
emperor but many priests, deacons, and laymen of high rank
were ready to accept everything that Isidore proposed, provided
only that the city could obtain additional defenders.
It was in this spirit that they consented to be present on
December 12, 1452, in the Great Church in order to celebrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>the Union and by so doing obtain aid in their time of mortal
anguish.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> The service was destined to be memorable. The
party which would not accept the Union took offence at the
reconciliation service. While the emperor and a host of
dignitaries were present in Hagia Sophia a crowd went to
the monk Gennadius, better known as George Scholarius,
and asked what they should do.</p>

<p>The man whom they went to consult was not a mere
monk who had won the popular ear. He was a scholar
with a European reputation, the most distinguished advocate
in the long contest between the rival systems of Aristotle
and Plato which marks the transition from mediaeval to
modern thought. He was the last of the great polemical
writers of the Orthodox Church whose works were studied
in the West as well as in the East. His great rival in the
controversy was Pletho, a celebrated Platonic scholar. Both
these writers had accompanied John Palaeologus to the
Councils of Ferrara and Florence.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>The reply of Gennadius, who was now a monk in the
monastery of Pantocrator (a little over a mile distant from
the Great Church), whither they had gone to consult him, was
distinct enough. He handed from his cell a paper asking
why they put their trust in Italians instead of in God. In
losing their faith he declared that they would lose their city.
In embracing the new religion they would have to submit to
be slaves.</p>

<p>Something like a riot followed, and drunken zealots ran
through the streets declaring that they would have no
Union with the Azymites&mdash;that is, with those who celebrate
with unleavened bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime the congregation in the Great Church, after
listening to a sermon from the cardinal, formally gave their
consent to the Union on condition that the decrees of
Florence should be again examined and, if need be, revised.
A Mass was celebrated in which Roman and Greek priests
took part; the names of Nicholas the Fifth and the restored
Patriarch Gregory were joined in the prayers, and both the
cardinal and the patriarch shared in the celebration in token
that the old schism was at an end and that the great reconciliation
had been accomplished.</p>

<p>The reconciliation was, however, a delusion and a sham.
Many who accepted it, says Ducas, gave utterance to the
thought, ‘Wait until we have got rid of Mahomet, and then it
will be seen whether we are really united with these Azymites.’
Notaras, the grand duke and subject of highest rank in the
city, was reported to have declared that he would rather see
the phakiola of the Turk than the veil of the Latin priest.
Those who conformed did so under compulsion. They
agreed with the mob in regarding the Latin priests as the
representatives of a foreign tyranny. The most devout
among the citizens were the most opposed to a change of
belief in order to obtain a temporal advantage. Without
going so far as Lamartine, who says ‘L’Église avait tué la
patrie,’ we may safely admit that it had greatly divided the
people in presence of their great enemy.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at a period within a few months
of the final siege of the city and have to limit our attention
to the struggle which is about to take place over against its
walls, to the incidents of this epoch-marking event, and to
the <i>dramatis personae</i> of the contest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of Mahomet.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Mahomet plays the principal part in the great tragedy
of the Capture of Constantinople, we may turn aside from
the narrative in order to form a general estimate of the
young man, leaving until after the conquest of the city the
attempt to make a more complete sketch of his character.</p>

<p>As he was only twenty-one years old when he became
sultan, the events of his subsequent life inevitably colour
any attempt to delineate him in his youth. There exist
many notices in regard to his character drawn by contemporary
writers, and though Gibbon’s remark, that it is
dangerous to trust either Turkish or Christian authors when
describing Mahomet, is useful as a warning, these notices
and especially the Life of Mahomet by Critobulus<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> enable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>us to get a fair view of the man. He was well-formed and
handsome, about the middle height, with piercing eyes and
arched eyebrows. His most conspicuous feature was his
long aquiline nose, which seemed to overhang his thick red
lips and made the Turks describe him in after years as
having the beak of a parrot surmounting cherries.</p>

<p>The dream of his boyhood was to capture Constantinople.
He would succeed where Bajazed and Murad had failed.
Ducas gives a striking picture of his sleeplessness and
anxiety while at Adrianople before the siege of the city
commenced. His one thought was how he might obtain
his object. He passed his days in active preparations. He
went in disguise among his men accompanied by two
soldiers to hear what they had to say of him and of his
enterprise, and is said to have killed any man who ventured
to recognise and salute him. He passed his nights arranging
the plan of his attack&mdash;where he should place his cannon;
where he would endeavour to undermine the walls; where
the attack with scaling ladders should commence. The
anxiety he displayed when on the eve of this and many
subsequent undertakings; his desire to learn the opinion
formed of him by his own men and by foreigners; his many
hasty acts and the many legends which grew up during his
lifetime and after his death representing him as a rash and
impulsive ruler, all indicate that he was of a highly strung
and nervous temperament.</p>

<p>There are two sides to his character, each well marked
and distinct; the man lived a double life, whereof one aspect
would almost seem to be irreconcilable with the other. In
one he presents himself as a student, sicklied o’er with
the pale cast of thought, doubting of everything and anxious
to learn what answers the best men of his time and of
former ages, philosophers and theologians, had to give to
the greatest problems of life. In the other aspect he is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>bloodthirsty tyrant, a <i>hunkiar</i> or drinker of blood; one
who recked nothing of human slaughter and who seems
even to have delighted in human suffering. Yet the
two lives are inseparably blended. He would turn from
study to slaughter, and after slaughter and torture would
show himself to be full of pity for the sufferings of his
victims.</p>

<p>Nature had endowed him with intelligence far above the
average of that possessed by men of his race. He was the son
of a slave, and probably of a Christian, and like so many of
the sultans before his time and until the middle of the
eighteenth century probably owed his intelligence to the
non-Turkish blood in his veins. His early struggles while
yet a lad, and the great responsibilities he had to assume in
order to protect his very life, had quickened his faculties
and had made him both suspicious and self-reliant. His
environment, among men who were simply soldiers of the
original Turkish type; the tradition of his house and race,
in accordance with which any slaughter or any cruelties
might be committed; the religion to which he belonged,
which regarded all non-Mussulmans as enemies of the true
faith, who were to be subdued: all tended to make him
regardless of human life. But amid his cruelties his better
nature and his more thoughtful side occasionally asserted
itself.</p>

<p>In one respect his characteristics are those of his race.
No man can show himself more cruel and relentless in
slaughter than the Turk whenever his religious sentiment
comes into play. The unbeliever is an enemy of God and of
Mahomet, and it is a sacred duty when he is fighting against
the Moslem to slay him. Those who are at war against
Islam must be utterly destroyed, root and branch, unless
indeed they will accept the faith. Men, women, and children
must alike suffer the penalty. But when no religious
sentiment obscures the natural feelings of humanity, the
same Turk is goodnatured and kindly. Probably no race
is more charitable towards its own poor or treats animals
with more kindness. Mahomet the Second both in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
cruelty towards his enemies and in his spasmodic kindness
was a not unfair representative of his race.</p>

<p>But in another respect the characteristics of Mahomet
are quite un-Turk-like. His interest in questions of philosophy
and theology, in science and even in art, recall the
names of Western rather than of Turkish rulers. It was
indeed his interest in theological questions that led to
various reports that he was an atheist,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> that he was an
unbeliever in the dogmas of his own religion and that he
contemplated embracing Christianity. That he felt an
interest in such questions separates him at once from the
mass of his race: for, probably more completely than the
professors of any other religion, Moslems accept their creed
without question.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>Phrantzes notes that when as a mere boy he had been
entrusted with kingly power, some of the old viziers had
warned Sultan Murad that it was not prudent to leave the
government to his son.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> Their warning was not altogether
disregarded, and the viziers who gave it paid dearly for their
counsels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet’s accession.</div>

<p>His father, Murad the Second, had died in February 1451
at Adrianople. When Mahomet learned the news he was
in Magnesia. Calling upon all who loved him to follow, he
hastened as rapidly as possible to Gallipoli. During the
two days he remained there a great crowd flocked to his
standard. Then he pushed on to Adrianople. On the day
after his arrival he was proclaimed sultan. Halil Pasha
the grand vizier and Isaac Pasha were in attendance, but
as they were the advisers who prevented the young
sultan from retaining supreme power, they were doubtful
of their reception and kept themselves in the background.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Mahomet, however, ordered Halil to take his place as grand
vizier and appointed Isaac Pasha governor of Anatolia or
Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Mahomet commenced his reign by one of those acts of
cruelty which at once proclaimed the brutal and the
treacherous side of his character. Being himself the son
of a slave mother and having a younger brother, named
Ahmed, an infant still at the breast, who was the son of
Murad by his marriage with the sister of the Serbian kral,
he ordered a certain Ali to drown the young Ahmed in his
bath. His predecessors had killed their brothers, but the
latter, as we have seen, were in open revolt. Von Hammer
states that there are Turkish historians who praise Mahomet
the Second for this act of cruelty, and this for the reason
that it is easier to kill a babe than a boy who is grown up.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>
Fearing apparently the effect so wanton an act of cruelty
would have upon his followers, Mahomet disclaimed all
participation in it and put Ali to death.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p>Mahomet is entitled to be classed among the men who at
an early age showed exceptional military skill. This skill was
developed during almost continual warfare to the end of his
reign. His industry, his boundless desire for conquest, his
careful attention to every detail that was necessary to secure
success, and his confidence in his own judgment, recall the
names of Alexander and Napoleon. From his first and most
important enterprise against Constantinople itself down to the
last expedition of his reign he was not merely the nominal
but the actual commander of the Turkish troops. He
would brook no interference. He allowed no council or
other body of his subjects to thwart his designs. The New
Troops or Janissaries, flushed with victory and already
conscious of that solidarity which in later years made them
the terror of sultans, exacted from him a donative on his
accession, but they paid dearly for their temerity and soon
learned that their new master would neither be dictated to
nor divide his sovereignty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>For the present we must be content to note that the
young sultan was a man of unusual intelligence, who as a
boy had accepted responsibility with eagerness; that he
still had in 1452 the alternate confidence and hesitancy of
youth; that he was of great energy, of studious habits, of
nervous temperament, painstaking in the formation of his
designs, ready to obtain the judgment of others, but otherwise
quick in arriving at a decision. His maxim in later
years was that in warfare secrecy and rapidity are the main
elements of success. In reply to an officer of high rank who
asked why great warlike preparations were being made he
answered, ‘If a hair of my beard knew, I would pluck it out
and burn it.’<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> His ambition was great. He proposed to
attack Naples, dreamed of leading his armies to the elder
Rome, and regarded his conquests as stages in a great
design of conquering the world.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> These objects were however
in the future. The immediate one before him was the
capture of the city, and to its accomplishment he directed
all his thoughts and all his energy without wavering until
he had attained it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conciliating embassies.</div>

<p>Within a few weeks of Mahomet’s arrival in Europe
from Magnesia ambassadors were sent to his court at
Adrianople from Constantine and other rulers in Europe
and Asia Minor who were under his suzerainty to congratulate
him on his accession. As his first care was to make
sure of his own position and to gain time, Mahomet
received them all with apparent cordiality and promised to
observe the treaties made by his father. At the request of
the representatives of the emperor he not merely confirmed
the existing treaties, but declared his willingness to pay an
annual sum of three hundred thousand aspers chargeable
upon the produce of the Strymon Valley for the maintenance
of Orchan.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>Then he returned to Caramania, where Ibrahim Bey, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>had already shown himself ready to join Hunyadi and other
enemies of the Turks, was in revolt.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> There must be no
repetition of the incident which had made Murad’s attempt
to capture the city a failure. No sooner had the sultan left
Europe than, with an indiscretion which Ducas condemns,
ambassadors from the emperor were sent to ask that the
pension promised for the support of Orchan should be
doubled and at the same time to demand leave, if the
request were refused, that Constantine might be at liberty
to set him free. The messengers insinuated that in such
case Orchan would be an acceptable candidate for the
Ottoman throne. The request was of course a threat, and
was so treated by Halil Pasha&mdash;who had been friendly to the
late emperor and who continued his friendship to Constantine&mdash;and
by Mahomet himself. When Halil heard their
demand he bluntly asked them if they were mad. He told
them that they had a very different man to deal with from
the easy-going Murad; the ink on the treaty was not yet
dry, and yet they came as if they were in a position to
demand better conditions than had been already granted.
‘If you think,’ said Halil, ‘you can do anything against us,
do it: proclaim Orchan prince; bring the Hungarians
across the Danube and take from us, if you can, the lands we
have captured; but I warn you that you will fail and that if
you try you will lose everything.’<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> The account given by
Ducas has every appearance of truthfulness. Halil felt that
his own attempts to save the city were being thwarted by
the emperor himself. He, however, promised to report to
Mahomet what they had said and kept his word.</p>

<p>His master dealt with the ambassadors much more diplomatically.
He was outside Europe, and it would be
inconvenient if any attempt should be made to prevent him
returning to Adrianople. Besides, he must have time to
come to terms with Caramania. He therefore represented
that he was quite disposed to accede to the demands submitted
to him, but that, as he was going to Adrianople in a
short time, it would be better that they should submit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>him there that which was judged best for the empire and
the citizens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Returns to Adrianople, and begins his active preparations.</div>

<p>Thereupon the sultan with all haste made terms with
Ibrahim Bey of Caramania and returned to his European
capital. When there he at once gave orders that the
pension to Orchan should no longer be paid, and sent to
arrest all the tax-gatherers in the Strymon Valley who were
collecting the money to pay it.</p>

<p>He had quieted one possible ally of the empire. He
addressed himself next to another opponent who had shown
that he could be terribly formidable. He made a truce with
John Hunyadi for three years and concluded arrangements
with the rulers of other states. He strengthened his army.
He amassed stores of arms, arrows, and cannon-balls. He
superintended the thorough reform of the administration of
the revenue, and in the course of a year he accumulated a
third of the taxes which would otherwise have been
squandered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Purposes building fort on Bosporus.</div>

<p>Then he determined to carry into execution a plan
which would give him a strong base for operations against
the city he was resolved to capture. He was already master
of the Asiatic side of the Bosporus. At what is now
Anatolia-Hissar he possessed the strong fortification built
by Bajazed. It is at the place where Darius crossed
from Asia into Europe and where the Bosporus is narrowest,
being indeed only half a mile broad. Mahomet already
possessed by treaty, made with his father, the right to cross
the straits and to march through the peninsula behind
Constantinople to his capital at Adrianople. He now,
however, proposed to build another fortification at some
point on the opposite&mdash;that is the European&mdash;shore. It
would serve the double purpose of enabling him to command
the straits and of giving him a base for obtaining his
supplies from Asia and for the attack by sea upon the city.
With a fleet already large at the Dardanelles and with the
command of the Bosporus, he hoped to isolate Constantinople
so far as to prevent it from receiving any aid
in men or supplies of food. The command of the Bosporus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
would be a blow to the trade of Venice and Genoa as well as
to the emperor. Ships would be prevented from trading
freely with, and bringing supplies from, the Black Sea. It
might have been expected that the emperor would have put
forth all his strength to oppose the execution of such a
design. The all-sufficient explanation is, that, even if his
naval strength had been sufficient to delay the crossing of
Mahomet’s crowd of builders, the army was too hopelessly
insignificant to hold the shore against that which could
soon arrive from Adrianople on its rear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remonstrances against project.</div>

<p>When the emperor and citizens learned, in the spring of
1452, the preparations which were being made by the
collection of building materials and the bringing together of
crowds of workmen, they recognised all the importance of
the project and its danger to the city. Ambassadors were
sent to the sultan at Adrianople to learn whether it was
possible in any way to divert Mahomet from his purpose.
They urged the existence of treaties with the grandfather,
the father, and even with Mahomet himself: treaties which
had expressly stipulated that no fortification or other building
should be erected on the European side of the Bosporus.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>
They claimed that these stipulations had hitherto been
scrupulously observed, that armies had been allowed to pass,
but Mahomet’s predecessors had prevented any of their
subjects putting up fortifications or other buildings. The
messengers urged upon the sultan that to break the treaties
was to commit an act of injustice to the emperor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet’s reply.</div>

<p>In reply, the sultan, who was determined to avoid war
till he was ready, declared to the messengers that he had no
intention of breaking treaties: a statement which was, of
course, in flagrant violation of the truth. He pointed out,
however, that in the time of his father the Italians had tried
to hinder the passage of his troops when it had become
necessary to fight the Hungarians, and urged that it had
become essential for the protection of his European possessions
that he should be in a position to prevent such
detention in future. He claimed that the land on which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>proposed to build his fortress belonged to him, and professed
to think it strange that the emperor should wish to place
any difficulties in the way of the execution of so necessary a
project. If indeed, he significantly added, the emperor was
not peaceably disposed, that would be a different matter.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>When the messengers reported their interview, the
emperor’s first idea was to fight, and he was only prevented
by the entreaties of the clergy and people from sending a
detachment of his troops to destroy the builders and their
work. Some indeed of the inhabitants were in favour of
such action, but the emperor<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> had to come to the miserable
conclusion that it was impossible to prevent the young
sultan from carrying out his project except by war in the
open country, and that for such war he was not prepared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Selects a site at Roumelia-Hissar.</div>

<p>When the spring of 1452 was further advanced the
sultan himself took the lead in the execution of his project.
He assembled thirty well-armed triremes and a large number
of transports and sent them from Gallipoli to the Bosporus.
At the same time he himself marched at the head of a large
army towards its European shore.</p>

<p>On his arrival he selected, with the aid of his engineers,
the most advantageous position for his proposed fortifications.
This was found immediately opposite Anatolia Hissar.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Building begins.</div>

<p>Once the plan had been decided upon, every available
man seems to have been set at work to aid in its speedy
execution. Mahomet himself superintended the construction
of the new fortification and pushed on the works with the
energy that characterised all his military undertakings.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the operations Constantine with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>object of saving the crops of the peasants around the city,
and of appearing to be reconciled to the project which he
could not prevent, sent provisions to the workmen. Mahomet
in reply, and probably with the intention of forcing on war
in the open, permitted his men to scour the country and
gather or destroy the crops. All the neighbouring churches
and houses, including the famous church of the Asomatoi at
Arnoutkeui, were destroyed to furnish material.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>The land enclosed, says Critobulus, was rather a fortified
town than a fort. The walls and towers still remain and
form the most picturesque object which the traveller sees on
his passage through the Bosporus. Each of two peaks is
crowned with a strong tower. These are connected by a
long high wall interrupted with smaller towers, and from the
two largest towers similar walls at right angles to the long
wall connect them with great towers on the shore at the
end of another line of walls parallel to the channel. Small
guns or bombards enabled the enclosure to be defended
against any attack by land. On the sea shore and under
the protection of the walls were stationed large cannon
which threw heavy stone balls and commanded the passage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Completed middle of August 1452.</div>

<p>The work had been commenced in March 1452. It was
completed by the middle of August of the same year. The
city had hoped to maintain peace and Turks had entered and
left it apparently without difficulty. When the fortification
was finished and Mahomet’s army had robbed the peasants
of their crops, this hope vanished. Constantine closed the
gates, making the few Turks within its walls prisoners. They
were, however, a few days afterwards sent to the sultan.
Upon the closing of the gates, Mahomet formally declared
<span class="sidenote">War declared.</span>war and followed up his declaration by appearing with an
army of fifty thousand men before the walls. But his preparations
for a siege were far from ready. After remaining
three days he withdrew on September 6 to Adrianople and at
the same time the fleet returned to the Dardanelles.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Capture of ships at Roumelia-Hissar.</div>

<p>Within the next few weeks the city as well as the
Venetian and Genoese colonies learned how greatly the
new fortification of Roumelia-Hissar had strengthened
Mahomet’s position. On November 10, two large Venetian
galleys under the command of Morosini were fired at as
they were passing and captured. A fortnight later, on
November 26, another Venetian ship was fired at and also
captured. Some of the crew were sawn in halves. These
captures, says Barbaro, led to the beginning of the war
with the Venetians. For the first time the Turks commanded
the Bosporus.</p>

<p>Now that he had provided himself with a safe base of
operations against the city and withdrawn to Adrianople,
Mahomet threw off all disguise, and calling together the
<span class="sidenote">Mahomet’s address to the pashas.</span>
principal officers of the army announced to them the
object of his preparations, which, in accordance with his
habitual practice, he had hitherto kept secret. Critobulus
gives us an address which he represents Mahomet as making
to his leaders. He describes the progress made by his
ancestors in Asia Minor, how they had established themselves
at Brousa and had taken possession of the Hellespont;
had conquered part of Thrace and Macedonia, Bulgaria,
Serbia, and even Selymbria, and had overcome nearly every
obstacle. The great barrier to their progress was the city
and the army of the Romans. Whatever the sons of Othman
wanted to do was opposed at Constantinople. The
citizens had fought them everywhere pertinaciously and
continually. This opposition must be ended; this barrier
removed. It was for his hearers, said Mahomet, to complete
the work of their fathers. They had now against them a
single city, one which could not resist their attacks; a
city whose population was greatly reduced and whose former
wealth had been diminished by Turkish sieges and by the
continual incursions made by his ancestors upon its territory,
a city which was now only one in name, for in reality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>it contained cultivated lands, orchards, and vineyards. Its
buildings were useless and its walls abandoned and for the
greater part in ruins. Even from its weakness, however,
they knew that from its favourable situation, commanding
both land and sea, it had greatly hindered their progress and
could still hinder it, upsetting their plans, and being always
ready to attack them. Openly or secretly it had done all it
could against them. It was the city which had brought about
the attack by Tamerlane and the suffering which followed.
It had instigated Hunyadi to cross the Danube and on every
occasion had been in every possible manner their great
enemy. The time had now come when in his opinion it
should be captured or wiped off the face of the earth. One
of two things: he would either have it within his empire,
or he would lose both. With Constantinople in his possession
the territories already gained could be safely held and
more would be obtained; without it, no territory that they
possessed was safe.</p>

<p>Critobulus professes that the sultan claimed to have
information that the Italians in Constantinople would not
give any aid to the emperor, and were indeed his enemies,
and that on account of the difference of religion there was
bitter strife between them and the Greeks. Mahomet
concluded by urging that there was great risk in delay and
that the city should be attacked before any aid could be sent
to its relief. He gave his vote for war, and nearly all the
assembly followed his example.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>Mahomet now pushed on his preparations for the siege
with the utmost activity. The general commanding the
European troops was ordered to take a portion of them into
the neighbourhood of Constantinople and clear the country.
This he did, and attacked in the usual Turkish fashion all
the villages on the route which still remained under the rule
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>of the emperor. Selymbria, Perinthos, and other places on
the north shore of the Marmora were sacked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hopes that siege could be avoided.</div>

<p>The inhabitants of Constantinople seem at first to have
hoped against hope, notwithstanding the construction of
the fortress at Roumelia-Hissar, that the sultan would have
remained content with his position on the Bosporus thus
strengthened. They soon realised that an attempt was
about to be made to capture the city far more serious than
any that had been made within living memory. They
knew their weakness and the strength of their foe. They
knew that in a siege they would be under greater disadvantages
than ever before; that conquest would mean falling
into the hands of implacable enemies, the slaughter of
their young men, the loss of all their property, the plunder
of their churches, and the enslaving of their women. The
statement of Critobulus is probable enough that the inhabitants
remarked to each other that in former sieges the
position of the city was better, because it had command of
the sea and the inhabitants had therefore only need to
defend the walls on the landward side. We may dismiss, as
being merely curious and characteristic of the period, the
stories of supernatural events which increased the tribulation
of the inhabitants, of earthquakes, and strange unearthly
groanings, of lightning and shooting stars, of
hurricanes, torrential rains and floods, and of other signs
which indicated the wrath of God against the city. Those of
the inhabitants who did not believe in omens had something
more serious to think about than perspiring pictures, men
and women possessed of the devil, and mad enthusiasts who
prophesied misfortune to the city, and helped to depress the
spirits of the fighters. Those who kept their heads, with
the emperor as their leader, behaved like men and met the
danger bravely. They set themselves in the first place to
strengthen the defences. Their first task was to repair the
walls, for which purpose tombstones and all other materials
available were freely employed. Arrows and all other kinds
of arms were collected.</p>

<p>During the whole of the winter the emperor and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
people pushed on their preparations. In November 1452,
<span class="sidenote">Arrival of Isidore with 200 soldiers; of Venetian ships;
of Cretans.</span>as we have seen, Cardinal Isidore had arrived with two
hundred soldiers sent by the pope. Six Venetian vessels&mdash;not,
indeed, intended for war but capable of being adapted to
such purpose&mdash;came to the city, and their captains together
with those of three large ships from Crete yielded to the
request and promises of the emperor and consented to render
help. The leading Venetian commander was Gabriel
Trevisano, who, in reply to the imperial request, consented to
give his services ‘per honor de Dio et per honor de tuta la
Christianitade.’<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> When the Venetian ships coming from
the Black Sea were destroyed by the Turks at Hissar, the
emperor and leading nobles, the cardinal and Leonard, with
the ‘bailey’ of the Venetian colony and its leading members,
held a council to arrange conditions on which Venice should
be asked to send aid. Their deliberations took place on
December 13, the day after the famous service of reconciliation
in Hagia Sophia, and on several following days. Trevisano
and Diedo, the most important sea captains, were also
present. An agreement was concluded and messengers
were sent to Venice to ask that immediate aid should be sent
to the city. Finally the council decided that no Venetian
vessel should leave the harbour without express permission.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of Justiniani.</div>

<p>On January 29 the city received the most important of
all its acquisitions; for on that day arrived John Justiniani.
A Genoese of noble family, he was well skilled in the art of
war and had gained great reputation as a soldier. On
board his two vessels were four hundred cuirassiers, whom
he had brought from Genoa, and others whom he had hired
at Chios and Rhodes, making together with his crew in all
seven hundred men.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> A soldier of fortune, he had come on
his own accord to offer his sword when he heard of the
straits in which the emperor found himself, and had received
a promise that in case of success he should receive the island
of Lesbos. He was cordially welcomed by the emperor and
nobles and was shortly afterwards, by the consent of all,
named commander-in-chief, with the powers of a dictator in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>everything that regarded the war. He at once took charge
of the work already begun of strengthening the defences.
He distributed small guns upon the walls where they could
throw their stone balls to greatest advantage. He classified
the defenders and appointed to each his station.</p>

<p>In the last days of March Trevisano with his crew, aided
also by Alexis (or Aloysius) Diedo, whose three galleys had
come from Tana on the Azof, reopened a foss from the
Golden Horn in front of the landward walls as far as the
ground remained level, and at the same time repaired the
walls in the neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> A few days later the Italians
were assigned to the most important positions on the landward
walls. Barbaro, with the enthusiasm of a Crusader,
gives a list of Venetian nobles who took part in the defences,
and this ‘for a perpetual memorial’ of his brave countrymen.</p>

<p>Justiniani appears at first to have chosen to defend the
walls at Caligaria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Closing the harbour.</div>

<p>On April 2 the chain or boom which defended the
entrance to the Golden Horn was either closed for the first
time or strengthened.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> It extended from the Tower of
Eugenius near Seraglio Point to the Tower of Galata,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>
within the Galata Walls, and near the present Moumhana,
and was supported on logs. Ten large ships, of which five
were Genoese, three from Crete, one from Ancona, and an
imperial ship, were stationed at the boom, bows towards it,
and with long triremes near them for support. The
guardianship of the boom was entrusted to the Genoese.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>By the end of March Mahomet’s preparations were
nearly complete. He had already summoned all available
cavalry and infantry from Asia and the parts of Europe
under his control. As they arrived he drilled, classified, and
formed them into bodies of cuirassiers (or men with breastplates),
slingers, archers, and lancers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Turkish army.</div>

<p>While it is impossible to state with anything like
certainty what was the number of fighting men whom
Mahomet was shortly to bring before the walls of the city,
the materials for forming a general computation are not
wanting. The Turkish army was composed of regulars and
irregulars. The first and most important division of
regulars were the Janissaries. After them came a great
horde of Turks from those who had occupied Asia Minor
and Europe. Every Turk was bound to serve, and a call had
been made on all. The Turkish nation was the Turkish
army. Among them were many men who represented the
class subsequently known as Derrybeys, chieftains who
held their lands from the sultan on condition of bringing a
number of retainers into the field during war. The
irregulars, or, as they may be conveniently called, the Bashi-Bazouks,
consisted partly of the poorest class of Turks, who
did not possess a horse, and partly of Christians attracted by
the hope of plunder.</p>

<p>Amid the estimates of the number of men in Mahomet’s
army, that of Barbaro may be taken as safe and substantially
correct. He takes note of both regulars and irregulars&mdash;that
is, of all the combatants&mdash;while he disregards the camp-followers
as non-combatants. He states, when speaking of
the siege, that there were a hundred and fifty thousand men
stationed between the Golden Horn and the Marmora. As,
excluding the men on the fleet, all Mahomet’s followers took
part in it, the number mentioned may be taken as Barbaro’s
estimate of the whole Turkish army. Cheirullah, a
Turkish chronicler, affirms that there were not more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>eighty thousand effective fighting men, excluding in this
estimate apparently the Bashi-Bazouks.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>Barbaro’s estimate of one hundred and fifty thousand
fighting men is substantially confirmed by Tetaldi, who states
that there were two hundred thousand men under Mahomet,
of whom a hundred and forty thousand were effective soldiers
including thirty thousand to forty thousand cavalry, the rest
‘being thieves, plunderers, hawkers, and others following
the siege for gain and booty.’<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> Taking the estimate of
Cheirullah and Tetaldi, we may perhaps safely say that in
the army of one hundred and fifty thousand men there
were at least twenty thousand cavalry.</p>

<p>In this great army the Janissaries played the most
important part and formed beyond all doubt the most
efficient division. These were at least twelve thousand in
number.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The name Janissaries signifies ‘New Troops,’
and was given by a famous dervish and saint, Hadji
Bektash, when they were formed, in 1326, into a new infantry
by Sultan Orchan. From their institution they constituted
a fraternity governed in religious matters by the rules of
Hadji Bektash.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> Under the care of the first Murad, the son
of Orchan, their organisation had been developed, and by the
time of Mahomet the Second they had already acquired
high repute for discipline and daring.</p>

<p>The part they played in the capture of the city and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>subsequent renown deserve a somewhat complete notice.
The order took its origin in a long recognised Moslem
rule, that when a people at war with Mahometans is
summoned to make submission and refuses it may be
enslaved, and that in such a case one fifth of the property
captured should belong to the sultan. Christian captives
fell within the limit of this rule. In practice, however, the
sultans by no means considered themselves bound to restrict
themselves to the prescribed one fifth. They held that
as many of the children as the conqueror thought fit should
be given over to him to be trained for the public, and
especially for military, services. Accordingly, without regard
to the fact that the parents had already surrendered one or
more sons to the ruler, they were often called upon to
furnish others. The demand for Christian children to be
given up absolutely to the sultan was regular and methodic.
No tithe or other tax required for the service of the Church
was ever claimed with more regularity and insistence than
this blood tax for the service of Islam. A formal examination
of Christian children available for service was made
every five years, when a Turkish inspector, at the head of a
troop of soldiers and bearing an imperial firman of authorisation,
visited the portions of the empire assigned to him. The
registers of the churches were carefully examined to see how
many children ought to be brought forward for inspection,
and the priests, under the penalty of death, were bound to
show a correct list. The boys selected were usually
between the ages of ten and twelve years. Those were
preferred who were distinguished either by their strength,
intelligence, or beauty. In addition to these regular and
legal contributions to the services of the state, it was the
custom of the pashas, on returning from the provinces to
bring presents of Christian children to their imperial master.</p>

<p>The boys thus taken away from their parents and their
homes were forcibly converted to Mahometanism. From the
day of their reception into Islam they were kept under strict
surveillance and instructed with the object of making them
useful servants of the sultan. After a while they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
divided according to their aptitudes and told off for special
training for different branches of civil and military service.
It is with the latter that we are most concerned, though it may
be mentioned that many of those who had been Christian
slaves rose to the highest positions in the civil service and
greatly increased the efficiency of Turkish rule. All were
thoroughly drilled in the observances and taught the precepts
of the Moslem religion. All were subjected to a severe
discipline, were trained to practise self-denial, to endure
hardships cheerfully and not to repine at scantiness of food
or loss of sleep. Day and night they were under supervision.
The obedience exacted from them towards their
superiors was absolute, prompt, and, in appearance at least,
willing. All were taught to be expert in archery, and to ride
well.</p>

<p>After a probation lasting usually six years, those who
were drafted into the military service were still subject to
severe restraints. Bertrandon de la Brocquière bears witness
to the excellence of their discipline, and the same testimony
is borne by a series of other witnesses for two centuries later.
What may be called the Articles of War to which they were
subject, besides prescribing absolute obedience to every
command of their chief, required abstinence from every kind
of luxury and the strict performance of the many rules of
devotion laid down by Hadji Bektash.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> All men who were
not within barracks at the hour fixed were detained for
punishment. No Janissary was allowed, until long after the
conquest, to marry.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the same Articles contained regulations
which enable us to understand how in time service
among the Janissaries came even to be coveted. Though
discipline was strict, punishment could only be inflicted upon
a Janissary by one of his own officers. It is true that, after
receiving the bastinado, the offender had to rise, bend low,
and salute the officer who had superintended the punishment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>but no disgrace was attached to this act of discipline. The boy
who was admitted into the brotherhood of the Janissaries was
provided for as completely as if he had become a monk. When
by reason of age or wounds he became weak, he was retired
from active service and received a pension of three aspers
daily more than he had received when on service.</p>

<p>In times of warfare the sternest features of the barracks
were relaxed. Camp life was the recreation, and furnished
the joy and hope, of the Janissary. War was for him
a delight. His regiment marched to battle with every
sign of rejoicing and of military display compatible with
discipline.</p>

<p>The effect of the long training, with its strictness on the
one hand and its relaxations on the other, was to develop an
<i>esprit de corps</i> among them such as has rarely existed in
any other army. Everything was done that could be done
to cultivate this spirit. Every means was employed to make
the Janissary live his life in and look only to the interests
of his regiment. He was forbidden to exercise any trade or
occupation whatever, lest he should possess an interest outside
his regiment. In the time of Suliman the sultan
ordered the aga of a regiment of Janissaries to be beheaded
because one of his men was found mending his clothes.
The officer was spared at the request of his comrades, but
the private soldier was dismissed from the service. The
regiment was to be everything to the Janissary; the outside
world nothing. No man was allowed to accumulate
wealth, although his regiment could do so. Each man
followed the good or ill fortune of the powerful body of which
he was a member.</p>

<p>The result was that the regiment represented to the
Janissary everything that he held dear. He became jealous
of its honour, and the regiment in its turn became exclusive
towards outsiders. The Janissary came before long to think
of his position as privileged and to regard entrance into
his corps as only to be allowed under severe restrictions. So
careful indeed did he become of the rights of his regiment
that before long no person born of Mahometan parents was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
admitted, even though his father had been one of themselves.
As a consequence of this cultivation of regimental rights,
the popularity of the New Troops became so great that many
young Christians of adventurous spirit voluntarily sought to
join their ranks.</p>

<p>The Janissaries developed into a species of <i>imperium in
imperio</i>. Perhaps the body in Western Europe to which
they may most aptly be compared is the Order of Knights
Templars. Each was a partly religious, partly military
Order. Each was jealous of its own privileges and constituted
a fraternity largely isolated from the rest of the
community. But the isolation of the Janissary was more
complete than that of the Templar at any time. The
Moslem had been cut off from his own family and had
forgotten all the Christians he had known as a child, and
his regiment had taken the place of father and mother, wife
and home. His individual rights had been merged in those
of his regiment. The resemblance between the Janissaries
and the Templars might be noted in one other respect&mdash;namely,
that their religion sat lightly upon them. Though
the former were bound by the precepts of Hadji Bektash,
these precepts were, from the Mahometan point of view,
extremely latitudinarian.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<p>All their discipline and training tended to make them
devoted to the sultan as commander-in-chief. The Janissary
had nothing to gain and nothing to fear from any person
except his military superiors. Each man’s promotion
depended on the arbitrary will of his commanding officer,
or ultimately of the sovereign. Each man saw before
him a career in which he could rise to the command of an
army or to other high office, provided he won the approval
of his sultan.</p>

<p>Such a military organisation had never been seen in the
world’s history, and furnished to the early sultans a force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>which was almost irresistible. Wholly Christian and largely
European in origin, it was yet completely Mahometan in
spirit and in action. It was indeed an army which would
have satisfied Frederick the Great or any other ruler who
has desired to model a force according to preconceived ideas.
Take a number of children from the most intelligent portion
of the community; choose them for their strength and
intelligence; instruct them carefully in the art of fighting;
bring them up under strict military discipline; teach them
to forget the home of their childhood, their parents and
friends; give them a new religion of a specially military
type; saturate them with the knowledge that all their hope
in life depends upon their position in the regiment; make
peace irksome and war a delight, with the hope of promotion
and relaxation from the hardships and restraints of the
barracks: the result will be a weapon in the hands of a
leader such as the world has rarely seen. Such a weapon
was the army of the Janissaries.</p>

<p>The success of Mahomet’s predecessors in the Balkan
peninsula had been largely due to the New Troops. Though
their numbers appear to have been limited to twelve thousand,
they had already proved their value. We have seen
that when John Hunyadi had put the Turks under Murad
the Second to rout, it was the Janissaries who saved the
day and turned the disaster of Varna into a great victory.
Their discipline and strength were even more triumphant
in the defeat of the great Hungarian on the plain of Cossovo
in 1448. Black John, as the Turks named him from the
colour of his banner, succeeded in putting to flight the
Anatolian and the Rumelian divisions of his enemy. But
the attack on the Janissaries failed utterly. They stood
like a wall of brass until the moment came for them to
become the attacking force, and through their efforts the
triumph of the sultan was complete.</p>

<p>The force which had thus shown its quality only five
years previously was by far the most important division
under Mahomet’s command. The ablest, bravest, most
terrible portion of the army of the arch-enemy of Christendom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
was composed exclusively from Christian families. The
most formidable instrument employed by the Turks for the
conquest of the Christians of South-eastern Europe and
for attacking the nations of the West was formed of boys
born of Christian parents, enslaved, forcibly converted to a
hostile religion, who yet became devotedly attached to the
slavery to which they had been condemned. It was their
boast in after years that they had never fled from an enemy,
and the boast was not an idle one.</p>

<p>The remainder of the Turkish forces which may be
classed among regular troops came from all parts occupied
by the Turks but mainly from Anatolia. Their organisation,
discipline, and powers of endurance probably made them as
formidable an army as any which a European power of the
period could have put into the field.</p>

<p>The Bashi Bazouks constituted an undisciplined mob
who were good enough to be employed where numbers and
wild courage were of use in annoying or weakening the
enemy. La Brocquière states that the ‘innumerable host’
of these irregulars took the field with no other weapon than
their curved swords or scimitars. ‘Being,’ says Philelphus,
‘under no restraint, they proved the most cruel scourge of a
Turkish invasion.’</p>

<p>In speaking of the Turkish host it must not be forgotten
that in 1453 hardly any European power can be said to
have possessed a standing army. It is with no surprise,
therefore, that we note that contemporary European writers
from the West speak with astonishment of the discipline
which prevailed. ‘Their obedience to superiors,’ says La
Brocquière, ‘is boundless; none dare disobey even when
their lives are at hazard, and it is chiefly owing to their
steady submission that such great exploits have been
performed and such conquests gained.’ The same writer
bears testimony to the great mobility of the Turkish army.
‘Ten thousand Turks on the march will make less noise
than a hundred men in our Christian armies. In their
ordinary marches they only walk, but in forced marches
they always gallop, and, as they are lightly armed, they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
thus advance further from evening to daybreak than others
in three days. It is by these forced marches that they
have succeeded in surprising and completely defeating the
Christians in their different wars.’<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>The army which Mahomet commanded was not merely
endued with the fatalism and confidence of an ordinary
army of Islam; it was engaged upon a work in which many
generations of Moslems had longed to take a part. The
prophet himself was represented in the Sacred Traditions
as holding converse with Allah respecting the capture of
New Rome, and was told that the Great Day of Judgment
would not come before Constantinople had been captured
by the sons of Isaac. On another occasion Mahomet
declared that ‘the best prince is he who shall capture
Constantinople, and his the best army.’ The inspired words
had filled his immediate followers with the determination to
capture the city. The Arabs attempted the task no less than
seven times. At the third, in 672, they were accompanied
by the aged Eyoub, who in his youth had been the standard-bearer
and favourite of the Prophet. The huge army had
sat down before the city during seven years, sowing the fields
on the neighbouring coasts and gathering in the harvest,
but determined to win the reward which Mahomet had
promised to those who should capture the New Rome.
Eyoub’s death before its walls and the failure in these Arab
attempts of the largest and most powerful army and fleet
which Islam could ever collect had not rendered the words
of the Prophet void. The sacred promise still held good
and served to stimulate every soldier to increased exertion.
Seven centuries had passed since the long struggle against
the Arabs, in which the Queen City saved European civilisation,
and now, once again in the fulness of time, that which
the early Moslems had desired to see was within the reach
of those who fought under a leader who bore the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>name as the Prophet. Among those who in the army were
under the influence of religious ideas or traditions the
coming attempt to capture the city was looked forward to
hopefully and joyfully. To the ignorant and thoughtless
among his barbarous followers the promise of unlimited
plunder which Mahomet the Second held out was a stronger
inducement; but to the better informed and more religious,
and to some extent to all, the hope of winning paradise
furnished a powerful allurement to battle or at least a
compensatory consolation at the prospect of death.</p>

<p class="tb">After this digression I return to the preparations which
Mahomet was making at Adrianople for the execution of his
great design, and to those which the emperor had in hand
for the defence of the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Urban’s great bombard.</div>

<p>In the first weeks of January, the fame reached Constantinople
of a monster bombard or gun which was being
cast in Adrianople. Ducas gives interesting information of
its history and describes it as the largest possessed by the
Turks.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1452, while Mahomet was finishing
the castle on the Bosporus, a Hungarian or Wallachian
cannon founder named Urban, who had offered his services
to the emperor and had been engaged by him, was induced
by higher pay to go over to the enemy. He would have
been content, says Ducas, with a quarter of the pay he
received from Mahomet.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> After learning from him what he
could do, the Turks commissioned him to make as powerful
a gun as he could cast. Urban declared that if the walls
were as strong as those of Babylon he could destroy them.
At the end of three months he had succeeded in making
a cannon which remained for many years the wonder of
the city and even of Europe, and marks an epoch in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>continually increasing power of guns. The casting was
completed at Adrianople.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<p>In January it was started on its journey to the capital.
Sixty oxen were employed to drag it, while two hundred
men marched alongside the wagon on which it was placed to
keep it in position. Two hundred labourers preceded it to
level the roads and to strengthen the bridges. By the end of
March<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> it was brought within five miles of the city. But,
though the fame of this monster gun has overshadowed all
the rest, we shall see that it was only one amongst many.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkish fleet.</div>

<p class="tb">Above all, says Critobulus, Mahomet had given special
attention to his fleet, ‘because he considered that for the siege
the fleet would be of more use than even his army.’<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> He
built many new triremes and repaired his old ones. A
number of long boats, some of them decked over, and swift
vessels propelled by from twenty to fifty oarsmen were also
ready. No expense had been spared. The crews of his fleet
were gathered from all the shores of Asia Minor and the
Archipelago. He selected with great care the pilots, the men
who should give the time to the oarsmen and the captains.</p>

<p>At the beginning of April, his fleet was ready to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>Gallipoli, which had been the place of rendezvous. Baltoglu,
a Bulgarian renegade, was placed in command. A flotilla of
a hundred and forty sailing ships started for the Bosporus.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>
Of these, twelve were fully armed galleys, seventy or eighty
were <i>fustae</i>, and twenty to twenty-five were <i>parandaria</i>.
Amid shouts from one ship to another, the beating of drums,
and the sound of fifes, all marking the delight of the Turks
that their period of inactivity was at an end, the fleet made
its way through the Marmora. The sight carried dismay to
the remnant of the inhabitants of the Christian villages
along the shores, for within the memory of none had such a
fleet been seen. Within the city itself the news of the enormous
number of vessels on their way was not less alarming.</p>

<p>The fleet arrived in the Bosporus on April 12 and
anchored at the Double Columns or Diplokionion just below
the present Palace of Dolma Bagtche.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>At the Double Columns the detachment of the fleet which
had come from the Dardanelles was joined by other vessels
which had been swept in from the Black Sea and the
Marmora. Phrantzes gives the total number at four
hundred and eighty.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> Many of the vessels from the Black
Sea were laden with wood or with stone balls.</p>

<p>The Turkish fleet under Baltoglu’s command thus consisted
of a number of vessels from all the shores of the
Marmora, the Bosporus, and the Black Sea. Among them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>were triremes, biremes, <i>fustae</i>, <i>parandaria</i>, and galleys. As
we shall find these terms recurring, it will be well to realise
what they signified. The trireme of the fifteenth century
was a long and fast vessel which had usually two masts,
was very low in the water and, though employing sails, was
mainly dependent for propulsion on her oars. The arrangement
of oars from which she derived her name was not in
tiers one above the other and thus requiring oars of different
length. The ‘banks’ or benches, unlike those in ancient
ships, were all on the same level. The oars were short and
all of the same length: but three oars projected through one
rowlock port, each oar working on a tholepin. ‘One man
one oar’ was the invariable rule. Three men occupied one
bench or seat. Down the middle of the trireme ran a
central gangway called the <i>histodokè</i>, primarily intended as
a rest for the mast, but upon which the officer passed to
and fro to keep time for the oarsmen. There were thus
three upon each side of him, or six men nearly abreast
throughout the length of the trireme. The arrangement
upon a bireme was of a similar character, except that two
men instead of three occupied one bench. There was also
but one mast. The <i>fusta</i> resembled the bireme in having
two oarsmen on each bench on each side of the <i>histodokè</i>
from the stern to the one central mast, but only one on each
side from the mast forward.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<p>The <i>fusta</i> was a lighter boat than the trireme, and could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>thus be propelled more rapidly. The <i>parandaria</i> were heavy
boats, probably not differing much from the sailing barges
or <i>mahoons</i> still used in the harbour of Constantinople, the
Bosporus, and Marmora. The name ‘galley’ was in the
fifteenth century applied to war vessels propelled by a single
bank of long oars on each side. Leonard employs the term
<i>dromon</i>, not, as it had been used in earlier days from about
500 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, as a generic term for war ships,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> but to indicate the
large <i>caiques</i>, usually of twelve oars, which could not be
classed as triremes, biremes, or fustæ.</p>

<p>Probably the majority of the vessels in Mahomet’s fleet
were not larger than the ordinary bazaar caiques which ply
between Constantinople and distant villages on the Bosporus
or the Marmora or are employed in deep-sea fishing.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkish army arrives before the walls, April 5.</div>

<p class="tb">Mahomet, leaving Adrianople in the early days of April
with the whole of his army, overspread and ravaged the
country which had not already been swept by the vanguard
of his force and arrived on the 5th of that month before the
city. He encamped at about a mile and a half’s distance
from the landward walls.</p>

<p>Apparently, before the arrival of the main body of
Mahomet’s army, a sortie was made by the Greeks and
Italians against those who had arrived, and this was possibly
led by Justiniani.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> They met at first with success,
wounded many and killed a few Turks, but when Mahomet
arrived the advantage of the besiegers in numbers was so
overwhelming that no further sorties were attempted. The
bridges leading across the foss to the Gates were broken
down; the Gates were closed and were not again opened
so long as the siege lasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>The Turkish army on April 6 advanced three quarters of
a mile nearer to the walls, and on the following day again
approached still closer. The imperial guard extended from
the height crowned by Top Capou<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> to the Adrianople Gate,
and thus occupied the valley of the Lycus. This district
was known as the Mesoteichion. Their camp was so near
to the walls as only to be just out of range of missiles
discharged by the besieged.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Formal offer of peace.</div>

<p>The law of the Koran requires, or is believed to require,
that before war is definitely declared there shall be a formal
offer of peace, and accordingly before the siege commenced
Mahomet made such a proposal. To men who knew their
own weakness and the tremendous odds against them any
such offer must have been tempting. He sent messengers
to declare that if the city were given up to him he would
consent to allow the citizens to remain; he would not
deprive them of their property, their wives or their children,
but take all under his protection. As the inhabitants knew
well the fate of a population when conquered by a Turkish
army, they might possibly have accepted the proposal, if
they had had any confidence in the oath of the proposer.
The answer sent was that they would consent to other
conditions, but never to the surrender of the city.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>Upon this refusal Mahomet at once made his dispositions
for a regular siege.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Topography of Constantinople.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to understand these dispositions and the operations
of the siege which had now begun it is necessary to take
account of the topography of the city. Constantinople in
modern times comprises not only Stamboul but the large
and even more populous district situated on the northern
shore of the Golden Horn. This district was known in
mediaeval times as Pera.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> On the slope of Pera hill towards
the Horn the Genoese were in possession of a walled city
called Galata. Sometimes this city is described as Galata
of Pera. In modern times, however, Pera is the name of
the city on the north of the Golden Horn, exclusive of
Galata. In 1453 what is now known as Stamboul was the
only portion of the present city to which the name Constantinople
was applied.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>The city about to be besieged is situated on a peninsula
at the south-west extremity of the Bosporus. It is, roughly
speaking, an isosceles triangle with its base to landward. One
of the sides is bounded by the Marmora and the other by the
Golden Horn. It was surrounded by walls, which, with a
few short intervals, still remain. On the two sides bounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>by the sea they were built close to the water’s edge. In
the course of centuries the Golden Horn had silted up a
deposit of mud which even before 1453 formed a foreshore
outside the north walls of a sufficient extent to have allowed
Cantacuzenus to open a foss from Seraglio Point to Aivan
Serai, formerly known as Cynegion. The side of the
triangle most open to attack was that which faced the
land and extended from the Horn to the Marmora. The
walls on this landward side, constructed mainly during the
reign of Theodosius the Second, had proved themselves
during a period of a thousand years sufficiently strong to have
enabled the citizens successfully to resist upwards of twenty
sieges, and previous to the introduction of cannon were
justly regarded as invulnerable.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>The landward walls are four miles long. From the
Marmora to a point where the land has a steep slope for
about half a mile down to the Golden Horn, they are triple.
The inner and loftiest is about forty feet high and is
strengthened by towers sixty feet high along its whole
length and distant from each other usually about one
hundred and eighty feet. Outside this wall is a second,
about twenty-five feet high, with towers similar to though
smaller than those along the inner wall. This wall alone is
of a strength that in any other mediaeval city would have
been considered efficient.</p>

<p>Between these two walls was the Peribolos or enclosure,
which, though of varying width, is usually between fifty
and sixty feet broad. Outside the second was yet another
wall, which was a continuation in height of the scarp or
inner wall of the ditch or foss and which may conveniently
be called a breastwork. This breastwork, like the other two,
was crenellated. Though, from the fact that it has been
easier of access than either of the others, the summit has
mostly perished, some portions of it are still complete. It
is important, however, to note that the third wall or breastwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
is disregarded by contemporary writers, and that they
speak of the second as the Outer Wall. A second enclosure,
called by the Greeks the Parateichion to distinguish it from
the Peribolos, exists between the second and the third walls.
The foss or ditch, which has withstood four and a half
centuries of exposure since it last served as the first line of
defence, is still in good condition. It has a width of about
sixty feet.</p>

<p>The landward wall contained a number of gates which are
conveniently described as Civil Gates and which during times
of peace gave access to the city over bridges which were
destroyed when it was besieged. The most important of
these for our present purpose are the Chariseus, the modern
Adrianople Gate; Top Capou or Cannon Gate, known in
earlier times as the St. Romanus Gate, and the Pegè or Gate
of the Springs, now called Silivria Gate. Besides these there
were Military Gates leading from the city through the inner
wall into the enclosures which were known in earlier times
by their numbers (counting from the Marmora end of the
walls) or from the division of the army stationed near them.
The most noteworthy of these were the Third or Triton
and the Fifth or Pempton. The latter is in the Lycus
valley, about halfway between Top Capou and the Gate of
Adrianople, and was spoken of during the siege as the St.
Romanus Gate.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>As the most important military events in the history of
the siege of Constantinople took place in the valley of the
Lycus, between the Top Capou on the south and the Adrianople
Gate on the north of the valley, it is desirable that the
configuration of the locality should be noted carefully. Each
of these gates is upon the summit of a hill, the Adrianople
Gate indeed being the highest point in the city and, as such,
having had near it, as is the almost invariable rule in lands
occupied by Greeks, a church dedicated to St. George, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>took the place of Apollo when the empire became Christian.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>
Between the two gates exists a valley, about a hundred feet
below their level, which is drained by a small stream called
the Lycus. The distance between the two gates is seven
eighths of a mile. The double walls of Theodosius connect
them, while in front of the Outer Wall was an enclosure with
the usual breastwork forming the side of the foss. The
Lycus enters below these walls through a well-constructed
passage still in existence, and flows through the city until it
empties itself into the Marmora at Vlanga Bostan. The
tower beneath which it has been led is halfway between the
Adrianople Gate and Top Capou. About two hundred yards
to the north of this tower is the Fifth Military Gate or
Pempton, spoken of sometimes by the Byzantines as the Gate
of St. Kyriakè, from a church within the city which was close
to it, called the Romanus Gate by the writers on the siege,
and on old Turkish maps described as Hedjoum Capou or
the Gate of the Assault.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> The foss has a number of dams
at irregular distances down each side of the valley. In its
lowest part no dams were necessary.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>The walls between Top Capou and the Adrianople Gate
were known as the Mesoteichion, and the name seems to
have been applied also to the whole of the valley. The portion
of the walls on either side of the Adrianople Gate, or
perhaps those only on the high ground to the north of it,
was known as the Myriandrion&mdash;a name which was applied
occasionally to the Gate itself. From a tower to which
Leonard gives the name Bactatinian, near where the Lycus
entered the city, to Top Capou, the walls were described as
the Bachaturean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>Though the two magnificent Theodosian walls were as
well constructed as elsewhere, and to the eye of an ordinary
observer the city was as strongly protected in the Lycus
valley as anywhere, yet this place appears to have been
considered by many of the enemies of the city as its weakest
point. Here, says Dethier, with whom Professor Van
Millingen agrees, was the Heel of Achilles.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> Many previous
invaders, ending with Murad in 1422, had encamped in the
Mesoteichion as the most suitable position for an attack
upon the city.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<p>The accompanying sketch of the walls will show their
general plan.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions a large detachment of the
defenders of such high lines of walls ought to have been on
the city side of the great Inner Wall. So few, however,
were the besieged, that all had to pass into the enclosures to
meet the enemy at the second or Outer Wall. Partly because
of the small number of men, but partly also because it had
been allowed to get out of repair,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> the Inner Wall, which, as
the highest and strongest, ought to have been the most
serious obstacle, was hardly relied upon as a means of
defence. Chalcondylas says<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> that the emperor and the leading
Greeks deliberated as to where the enemy was to be
resisted, and that they decided that they should defend the
Outer Wall, which was strengthened by the foss in front of
it, as had been done when Murad had attacked the city thirty-one
years before. Leonard expressly states that the imperial
troops were sufficient to guard only the Outer Wall, and the
stockade which, at a late period of the siege, replaced a portion
of it. As his own countrymen took part in this task, his testimony
is entirely credible.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> He adds, however, that in his
opinion this plan of defence was a blunder; that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>always persuaded that the lofty Inner Wall ought to have
been kept ready as a refuge in case of retreat; that those
walls which, through neglect or hard weather, had become
broken or useless for operations against the enemy, might
have been repaired even within the time which elapsed
between the proposal for war and the commencement of the
siege. Had they been repaired and guarded, they would
have provided a reserve of safety to the city. It is when
regretting that these repairs were not undertaken that, while
excusing the emperor, Leonard breaks out into indignation,
justifiable if his belief was well founded<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> against two persons
in particular, Jagarus and a monk named Neophytus who
had embezzled the moneys which had been bequeathed for
the repair of the walls, and declares that the city was lost
through the rascality of public robbers. Through their
dishonesty, the besieged were driven to place all their hope
in the Outer Wall and the foss. The Jews, he adds, were
more prudent who when, at the siege of Jerusalem, they
were defeated at the first wall, retreated to the second, and
then to the third, by which they prolonged the siege of
Vespasian and Titus for four years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>
<p>Probably the opinion of the soldiers on such a question
was worth more than that of the archbishop.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the defenders of the city took
up their position in the Peribolos or enclosure. The broken
Inner Wall was behind them, the strong Outer Wall was in
front. The Military Gates from the city into the enclosure
were few and far between, there being only one usually in
the long distance between the Civil Gates. The only other
entrances into the enclosures were at the ends terminating
at the Civil Gates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disposition of Mahomet’s army.</div>

<p>With this explanation we may now understand the disposition
of his troops and cannon made by Mahomet. He
placed Zagan Pasha at the head of an army which was
charged to guard the whole of Pera, to watch the Genoese
in Galata and the whole of the northern shore of the Golden
Horn, together with a part of the southern shore as far as
the Woodgate or Xyloporta, which was at the extremity of
the landward walls. He was ordered to build a bridge
over the upper portion of the Horn, so that his troops might
take part in the attack upon the city.</p>

<p>The attack upon the landward walls between the
Woodgate and up the hill in front of the palaces of Blachern
and Porphyrogenitus, and as far as the Chariseus or Adrianople
Gate, was entrusted to Caraja Pasha, the head of the European
division. Certain of the guns were given to him in order that
he might attack the wall at one of its weakest parts, probably
where it runs at right angles to the end of the foss.</p>

<p>Isaac Pasha, the head of the Asiatic troops, and Mahmoud,
both men who had had great experience in war, commanded
the Asiatic division, which covered the ground between Top
Capou and the Marmora.</p>

<p>The most important position, however, was that which
existed between the Adrianople Gate and Top Capou known
as the Mesoteichion. This was the place which Mahomet
chose as the principal point of attack. There, he considered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>was the Achilles’ heel of the city. There, with Halil Pasha
under him, were his head-quarters. His lofty tent of red
and gold<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> was pitched about a quarter of a mile from the
walls on a small knoll, which is described as opposite the
Adrianople Gate and also as opposite that of Romanus.
His tent was surrounded by those of the invincible Janissaries
who, with other chosen troops, constituted his bodyguard
and occupied the same valley.</p>

<p>The Turkish army extended in front of the entire length
of the landward walls. The Turks had dug a trench for their
own defence in front of the whole of their line, and had placed
a wooden palisade upon the earth thus dug out. This was
quite near the edge of the foss itself and was pierced at
intervals, so that, while it protected the besiegers, it also
allowed them to keep up a constant fire on the besieged.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p>On the Marmora the walls were to be watched by the
fleet under Baltoglu from the southern end of the landward
walls, round the present Seraglio Point as far as Neorion,
which was near the end of the boom. The main object of
the fleet was, however, to force an entry into the harbour,
and for this purpose to capture or destroy the ships at the
boom, an object which Baltoglu attempted to attain from
the very commencement of the siege.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p>The city was thus under attack on two sides, the third&mdash;namely,
that looking over the Golden Horn&mdash;protected by
the boom, was for the present inaccessible to the Turkish
fleet.</p>

<p>The difficulty of determining the number and disposition
of Mahomet’s cannon opposite the landward walls arises
from the fact that the position of several of them was
changed and that their numbers possibly varied. Phrantzes
mentions fourteen batteries along the length of the wall,
each containing four guns. Barbaro speaks of nine batteries.
Montaldo says that the Turks had in all two
hundred guns or ‘torments.’<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> Each of the nine batteries
was strengthened by the addition of a heavy gun. Critobulus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>represents Mahomet as stating after his guns had done their
work that he had opened a way into the city at three places,
and this declaration affords a safe guide to the general
disposition of the cannon. These were, first, between the
present Tekfour Serai and the Adrianople Gate; second,
opposite or near the Pempton or Gate of the Assault (usually
spoken of by contemporaries as the Romanus Gate<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>) in
the Lycus valley, and the last near the Third Military Gate
between the Pegè or Silivria Gate, and the Rhegium Gate,
now called Mevlevihana Capou. Here were the three
principal stations of Mahomet’s cannon. At these three
places the ruined condition of the wall bears testimony to
the vigorous attack of cannon. At them and nowhere else
is it possible to pass over the foss, the breastwork and Outer
Wall, and to see that the Inner Wall has been so broken
down that a passage into the city was possible.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>Three cannon are especially remembered on account of
their great size. According to Leonard, the largest&mdash;that,
namely, cast by Urban, which threw a ball of twelve hundred
pounds weight&mdash;was first placed at Caligaria<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> which then, as
now, was ‘protected neither by a foss nor by a front wall.’ It
was destroyed either by the besieged or through an accident
by which Urban was killed, after it had done considerable
damage to the walls.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> It was, however, recast and transferred
to the Lycus valley, where it demolished the Bactatinean
tower.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> The statement of Chalcondylas is that of
these three large guns one was stationed opposite the Imperial
Palace, probably at Caligaria, the second opposite the
Romanus Gate, where the sultan had fixed his camp, and the
third between them.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>The largest and most powerful gun remained during the
siege at the Mesoteichion, in front of the imperial tent.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>These cannon are variously described as bombards,
machines, skeves, helepoles (or ‘takers of cities’), torments,
heleboles, and teleboles. They threw stone balls of great size.
The balls had been brought from the Black Sea. The largest,
says Chalcondylas, was fired seven times a day and once
each night. Archbishop Leonard states that he measured one
which had been fired over the wall, and found it to be eleven
spans (or eighty-eight inches) in circumference. Nor is such
measurement exaggerated. Some of the stone balls have been
preserved. They were probably fired over the wall, did not
break, and remain nearly in the position where they fell. I
have measured two of them, and they are exactly eighty-eight
inches in circumference.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> Tetaldi states that there were ten
thousand culverins, and the same number is given by
Montaldo. The number is possibly exaggerated. Yet
Leonard speaks of ‘innumerable machines’ being advanced
towards the wall, and afterwards of a great number of small
guns being employed to batter the walls along all their lines.
None of the cannon, I think, were mounted on wheels: the
Great Cannon certainly was not, for Critobulus describes how
it was first carefully pointed towards the object intended to
be struck, and then embedded in its position with blocks of
wood preparatory to firing.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with the disposal of the large cannon,
orders were given to fill up the ditch in front of them.</p>

<p class="tb">When we turn from the preparations made by Mahomet
to besiege the city to those which the emperor and the
<span class="sidenote">Constantine’s army.</span>citizens had made or were making, the first point which
strikes us is the enormous disparity in numbers which the
respective leaders had under them. To meet the mighty
host of trained warriors under Mahomet, the emperor had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>only about eight thousand men. This is the estimate in
which nearly all writers concur. Phrantzes had exceptional
means of forming a judgment on this point. He states<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>
that Constantine ordered a census to be made of all men,
including monks, capable of bearing arms, and that when the
lists were sent in he was charged with making the summary.
This showed that there were four thousand nine hundred
and eighty-three available Greeks and scarcely two thousand
foreigners. The result was so appalling that he was charged
by the emperor not to let it be known. The estimate made
by Phrantzes, though almost incredible, is substantially
confirmed by other writers. Tetaldi says that there were
between six thousand and seven thousand combatants within
the city ‘and not more.’<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> Leonard makes the number a
little higher and gives as an estimate six thousand Greeks
and three thousand foreigners. Dolfin, probably following
Leonard, arrives at a like conclusion. Ducas says that
‘there were not more than eight thousand.’</p>

<p>The powerful contingent of three thousand Italians is
worthy of separate notice. Nearly all were of Venetian or
Genoese origin. In them the city had the aid of men
belonging to the most virile communities in the Mediterranean.
The story of the trading establishments in the
Levant, the Archipelago, and the Black Sea belonging to
the citizens of Venice and Genoa is a brilliant record of
daring, of adventure, and of energy. The expansion of the
two states began about the time of the Latin conquest.
Everywhere along these shores are the remains of castles
built by Genoese or Venetians during the two centuries
preceding the Moslem conquest. Dandolo had played the
most important part in the capture of the city in 1204, and
the capture gave Venice the sovereignty of the seas. The
Genoese had aided the Greeks to recapture the city. Each
republic had gained territory in Eastern lands. Each
owned certain islands in the Aegean. The Genoese had
succeeded in forming a large and important colony in
Galata, which was now a fortified city. To check Turkish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>progress was almost as important to the republics as to the
Greeks. Venetians and Genoese recognised that once Constantinople
was in the hands of the sultan, there would be
an end of their development eastward of Cape Matapan.
They were, therefore, both fighting for their own interests.
They had much to lose and nothing to gain by the success
of Mahomet. Nor were the soldiers of the republics
destitute of chivalrous spirit. The rough sailor-surgeon, Barbaro,
notes that other Venetians as well as Trevisano were
willing to fight for the honour of God and the benefit of
Christendom. Leonard and other writers testify to equally
lofty sentiment on the part of the Genoese Justiniani. In
their character and conduct, not less than in their mixed
motives, derived from self-interest and chivalry, these foreign
adventurers remind English readers of the Drakes, Frobishers,
Raleighs, and other heroes of our own Elizabethan period.
Unhappily for the city and for civilisation, Venice was unable
to send more men before the final catastrophe. But to the
eternal glory of the Venetians within the city, whose names
are duly recorded by Barbaro ‘for a perpetual memorial,’
and of the Genoese who aided them, the conduct of the
combatants from both republics was worthy of the compatriots
of Marco Polo and of Columbus.</p>

<p class="tb">On the one side was an army of one hundred and fifty
thousand men, containing at least twelve thousand of the
best trained troops in the world; on the other, a miserable
number of eight thousand fighting men to defend a
length of between twelve and thirteen miles of walls.</p>

<p>The emperor, with Justiniani, completed the arrangements
for the defence of the city. Justiniani with the
seven hundred men he had brought with him to Constantinople,
consisting of his crew and four hundred men in
armour,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> was at first placed in charge of the walls between
the Blachern Palace and the Adrianople Gate, but was soon
transferred with his men and some of the bravest Greeks to
the Lycus valley as the position of greatest importance, honour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>and danger. The emperor himself fixed his headquarters in
the same position. In this valley the choicest troops of the
city and those of the sultan were thus face to face. Between
the Adrianople Gate and Tekfour Serai was a contingent of
Italians under three brothers, Paul, Antony, and Troilus
Bocchiardo. They were stationed, says Phrantzes, at the
Myriandrion, because there the city was in great jeopardy;<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>
Leonard says, ‘in loco arduo Myriandri;’ Dolfin, speaking
of the same place under a somewhat different name, says ‘in
loco arduo Miliadro, dove pareva la cita piu debole.’<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> This
contingent had been provided by the Bocchiardi at their own
cost. The men were furnished with spingards and balistas
for hurling stones at the enemy. The Caligaria&mdash;that is,
the gate of that name, now called Egri Capou or Crooked
Gate&mdash;and the walls thence as far as Tekfour Serai were
defended by Caristo, an old Venetian, and by a German
named John Grant, who had taken service with the emperor.
Over the imperial palace at Blachern waved the flag of the
Lion of St. Mark side by side with the banner of the
emperor, to denote that Minotto, the Venetian bailey, was
in command in that district. Archbishop Leonard and
other Genoese, together with Hieronymus, were with him
to assist in defending the walls as far as the Xyloporta on
the edge of the Golden Horn.</p>

<p>On the emperor’s left the walls were guarded by Cataneo
and Theophilus Palaeologus at the Silivria Gate, while
Contarini, the most renowned member of the Venetian
colony, and Andronicus Cantacuzenus defended the walls
around the Golden Gate and to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> Under these
leaders, along the whole length of the landward wall, Genoese,
Venetians, and Greeks fought side by side.</p>

<p>Between a tower in the current off Seraglio Point and
the Imperial Gate&mdash;that is, at the Acropolis, and thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>guarding the entrance to the harbour<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a>&mdash;Gabriel Trevisano,
already mentioned as the Venetian noble who was serving
‘per honor de Dio et per honor di tuta la Christianitade’
was in command.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> There, says Leonard, he did his duty as
a shepherd and not as a hireling.</p>

<p>Near him for the present were the captains and the
crews of the two Cretan ships who kept the Horaia
Gate. Cardinal Isidore was at Seraglio Point with a body
of two hundred men guarding the walls commencing at the
Great Tower of St. Demetrius. James Contarini was
stationed at Psamatia and guarded the western portion of
the Marmora walls. The Caloyers or Greek monks were
also in this part of the city, and near them was a small
band of Turkish mercenaries under the command of Orchan.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a>
The Grand Duke Notaras with a small reserve of men was
near the church of the Apostles, now occupied by the
Mahmoudieh Mosque, to render aid wherever it might be
required.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> Lastly, Diedo, who had been made admiral of
the fleet, was stationed near the end of the boom.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>The cannon possessed by the besieged seem to have been
few and of little value. Leonard relates that they were
short of powder and of arms, and that it was impossible to
use the cannon on account of the damage they were found
to do to their own walls. Zorzo Dolfin confirms these statements
and adds that the Venetians were short of saltpetre.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>The emperor and Justiniani had collected arms and
various kinds of missiles, shot and arrows, and all sorts of
machines.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>

<p>Each army was equipped in much the same manner.
Modern, mediaeval and ancient arms and equipment were
employed side by side with each other. We read of dolabras,
of wooden turrets, and of the Turks raising their shields
above their heads and making a testudo.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Stone shot are
thrown by the great slings, or catapults, known as mangonels
or trebuchets, as well as by cannon. While each side relied
largely on the bow, each side also discharged missiles at the
other from arquebuses and culverins. Long-bows were so
numerous in the Turkish army that the discharge of arrows
from them is described by more than one author as darkening
the sky. Cross-bows appear also in the description of the
siege under the names of balistae and spingards. ‘The
archers,’ says La Brocquière, ‘were the best troops the
Turks possessed.’<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> The ordinary soldier in the Turkish
army was armed with a wooden shield and a scimitar. A
few, among both the besiegers and the besieged, were
armed with lances.</p>

<p>Uniformity in equipment or dress was not even attempted.
Tetaldi says that in the Turkish army less than a fourth
were armed with hauberks and wore jacques&mdash;that is, quilted
tunics of cotton or leather, well padded;<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> that some were
well armed in French, some in Hungarian, fashion, some
in other modes; some had iron helmets, and others long-bows
or cross-bows.</p>

<p>The Janissaries were trained to act either as cavalry or
infantry. They carried bows and small wooden shields, and
were further armed with a long lance or with a scimitar.
The Anatolian division was composed mostly of cavalry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Leonard, however, points out that though the cavalry were
numerous they fought as infantry. Philelphus, who was a
contemporary envoy at the Porte, states that the Anatolian
troops were armed with scimitars, maces, and small shields.</p>

<p>The great superiority of the Turks as regards arms was in
the cannon. While, as we have seen, the besieged could not
use such cannon as they had for fear of destroying the walls
from which they were fired, the Turk was under no such
disadvantage, and was entirely up to date with the very
latest improvements in heavy guns. The siege of Constantinople
in fact marks an era in the employment of large cannon
and gave to the world the first noteworthy intimation that
the stone walls of the Middle Ages constituted no longer a
secure defence. Cannon had, indeed, been known a century
and a half earlier in Western Europe, and had been employed
both by and against the Turks on the Danube;<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> but the
astonishment which the introduction of large cannon caused
at the siege of Constantinople shows that while the invention
itself was new to the people of the East, its development
was hardly less surprising to those of the West. Critobulus
remarks upon the siege that ‘it was the cannon which
did everything.’ So novel was the invention that he
gives a detailed account of the casting of one of the big
guns, and explains how the powder was made, how the
gun was mounted and loaded, and how it fired its stone
ball. ‘When fire is applied to the touch-hole, the powder
lights quicker than thought. The discharge makes the
earth around it to tremble, and sends forth an incredible
roar. The stone ball passes out with irresistible force and
energy, strikes the wall at which it has been aimed, overthrows
it, and is itself dashed into a thousand pieces.’ No
wall was so hard or had such power of resistance that it
could withstand the shock. Such is the incredible and unthinkable
nature of the machine to which, as the ancient
tongue had no name for it, he suggests that of helepolis or
‘Taker of Cities.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>
<p>In the early days of the siege, or possibly just before it
began, Mahomet attacked all the Greek villages which had
escaped the savagery of the troops in their march to the
capital. Some kind of fortification existed at Therapia on
the Bosporus. This was attacked by the Janissaries. Many
of its defenders were slain, and the remainder, consisting of
forty men, seeing that resistance was useless, surrendered.
They were all impaled. Another fortification, known as
Studium, was similarly attacked. Its thirty-six survivors
were taken to a spot near the wall, so that they might be
seen by the citizens, and were there impaled. At the
island of Prinkipo the round tower still exists which had
been a place of refuge for the protection of the inmates of
the adjacent monastery. The monastery itself had been
used as a place of retreat for the princely members of the
imperial family, and had thus given its name to the Princes
Islands. Baltoglu was sent with a portion of the fleet to
attack it. Although he had cannon with him, he was unable
to destroy its solid Byzantine masonry, and the thirty well-armed
defenders refused to surrender. His crews thereupon
cut down the neighbouring brushwood, and with this, with
straw, and with sulphur, he smoked out the garrison. While
some perished in the flames, others broke through the
burning materials and surrendered. The admiral killed
those who were armed, and sold into slavery the other inhabitants
of the island.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<i>THE SIEGE</i></h2></div>

<p class="indent">INVESTMENT BY TURKS; FIRST ASSAULT FAILS; ATTEMPT
TO FORCE BOOM; ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE SHIPS BRINGING
AID; GALLANT FIGHT AND DEFEAT OF TURKISH
FLEET; TURKISH ADMIRAL DEGRADED; TRANSPORT OF
TURKISH SHIPS ACROSS PERA INTO THE GOLDEN HORN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have now arrived at the last act of the tragedy of
Constantinople. The Queen City is cut off from the outside
world. Its small fleet dare not attempt to pass outside the
boom which excludes the Turkish fleet. An overwhelming
force of ships had been collected to keep out supplies of
men or provisions. Before its landward walls is an army of
one hundred and fifty thousand fighting men and a crowd
perhaps equally numerous awaiting their chance of plundering
the remnant of that wealth which had once been contained
in the great storehouse of the Western world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet’s army before the walls on April 7, 1453.</div>

<p>On April 7 Mahomet’s army had taken up its position
along the whole four miles length of the landward walls
from the Marmora to the Golden Horn, and with the aid of
the fleet prevented all access to or egress from the city. But
the men in it had made up their minds to hold it or to die.
They began on the first day of the siege to make the best show
they could. At the emperor’s request, but also at their own
desire, the crews of the galleys under Trevisano and of two
others, numbering in all a thousand men, landed and marched
along the whole length of the landward walls in presence
of the enemy with the object of proving to the Turks that
they would have to fight Venetians as well as Greeks.</p>

<p>On the 9th the ships in the harbour were drawn up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
battle array, ten being at the boom and seventeen in reserve
further within the harbour.</p>

<p>The Turkish army on the 11th placed its guns in position
before the walls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cannonading commences April 12.</div>

<p>On the 12th the batteries began playing against the
walls and, with ceaseless monotony, day and night the
discharge of these new machines was heard throughout the
city during the next six days. Their immediate effect soon
showed that the walls, solid as they had proved themselves
in a score of former sieges, were not sufficiently strong to
resist the new invention. The huge balls, fired from a
short distance amid a cloud of the blackest smoke, making a
terrible roar and breaking into a thousand pieces as they
struck the walls, so damaged them that they required daily
and constant repair. The narratives of those present agree
in representing the defenders from the very commencement
of the bombardment as being constantly engaged in repairing
the injury done by these ‘takers of cities.’ Large and
unwieldy as they were, unmounted and half buried amid the
stones and beams by which they were kept in position, they
were yet engines of destruction such as the world had never
seen. Planted on the very edge of the foss and requiring
such management and care that the largest could only be
fired seven times a day, they gave proof within a week of
their employment that they could destroy slowly but surely
the walls which had stood since the reign of the younger
Theodosius. The defenders in vain suspended bales of wool
and tried other means of lessening the damage. All they
could accomplish was to repair and strengthen the damaged
portions as rapidly as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Damage done by cannon by April 18.</div>

<p>Already by April 18 a part of the Outer Wall and even
two great towers of the Inner had been broken down in the
Lycus valley.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> Justiniani had been compelled to take in
hand the construction of a stockade for their defence ‘where
the attack was the fiercest and the damage to the walls
the greatest.’ The walls of the foss, including the breastwork,
had been broken down, the foss itself in this place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>partly filled. The wonderful success already achieved by
his great guns led Mahomet to believe that he could already
capture the city. Accordingly, at two hours after sunset on
April 18 he gave orders for the first time to attempt the city
by assault.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to capture city by assault on April 18 fails.</div>

<p>Infantry, cuirassiers, archers, and lancers joined in
this night attack. They crossed the foss and vigorously
attempted to break through or destroy the Outer Wall.
They had observed that in the repairs the besieged had
been driven to employ beams, smaller timber, crates of
vine cuttings, and other inflammable materials. These they
attempted to set on fire; but the attempt failed. The
defenders extinguished the fires before they could get well
hold. The Turks with hooks at the end of lances or poles
then tried to pull down the barrels of earth which had been
placed so as to form a crenellation and in this way to expose
the defenders to the attacks of the archers and slingers.
Others endeavoured to scale the hastily repaired and partially
destroyed wall. During four hours Justiniani led his Italians
and Greeks in the defence of the damaged part, and after a
hard conflict the Turks were driven across the foss with a loss
in killed and wounded estimated by Barbaro at two hundred.</p>

<p>The attack was local and not general, though Barbaro
remarks that the emperor began to be in doubt whether
general battle would not be given on this night, and ‘we
Christians were not yet ready for it.’ The failure of this
the first attack stimulated Greeks and Italians to press on
the repairs to the Outer Wall. Every day, however, there
were new assaults made at one place or another, but especially
in the Lycus valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to force boom.</div>

<p>A few days after the return of Baltoglu with the fleet
from Prinkipo, and probably contemporaneously with the
attack in the Lycus valley on the 18th, the admiral was
ordered to force a passage into the Golden Horn.</p>

<p>His fleet, counting vessels of all kinds, probably now
numbered not less than three hundred and fifty ships. By
their aid Mahomet hoped to gain possession of the harbour
by destroying or forcing the boom. Accordingly, Baltoglu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
sailed down from the Double Columns, towards the ships
stationed for its defence, and endeavoured to force an entry.
The Turkish crews came on with the battle-cry of ‘Allah,
Allah!’ and when within gun- and arrow-shot of their
enemies closed bravely for the attack. The cuirassiers tried to
burn the vessels at the boom with torches; others discharged
arrows bearing burning cotton, while others again endeavoured
to cut the cables of some of the ships so that they might be
free to destroy the boom. In other parts they sought to
grapple with the defending vessels and if possible to capture
them. Both sides fought fiercely, but the Greeks and
Italians, under the leadership of the Grand Duke Notaras,
had provided against all the Turkish means of attack. The
defending ships were higher out of the water than those of
the Turks, and this gave them an advantage in throwing
stones and discharging darts and javelins. Stones tied to
ropes had been taken aloft on the yards and bowsprits, and
the dropping of these into vessels alongside caused great
damage. Barrels and other vessels full of water were at
hand to extinguish fire. After a short but fierce fight the
assailants judged that for the present at least the attempt
to capture the boom and thus obtain an entrance into the
harbour was hopeless, and amid taunts and shouts of joy
from the Christians withdrew to the Double Columns.</p>

<p>On April 20 we come to an incident at once interesting
and suggestive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to capture ships bringing aid.</div>

<p>In the midst of a story which is necessarily depressing
from the consciousness that it is that of a lost cause, one
incident is related by all Christian contemporary writers,
whether eye-witnesses or not, with satisfaction or delight.
This is the incident of a naval battle under the walls of the
city itself. Spectators and writers dependent on the testimony
of others who had seen the fight differ among themselves
as to details but agree as to the main facts.</p>

<p>Three large Genoese ships on their way to Constantinople
had been delayed at Chios<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> by northerly winds during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>month of March and part of April. Accounts differ as to
the object of their voyage. One would like to believe the
statement of Critobulus that they were sent by the pope to
bring provisions and help to the city and as an earnest of
the aid he was about to furnish, and that thirty triremes and
other great vessels were in preparation.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> But Barbaro, who,
as a Venetian, seldom loses an opportunity of depreciating
the Genoese, says that they had been induced to sail for the
city by the imperial order allowing all Genoese ships
bringing provisions to enter their goods duty free. The
statement of Leonard, archbishop of Chios, that they had
on board soldiers, arms, and coin for Constantinople would
appear to confirm that of Critobulus.</p>

<p>The arrival of a fleet from Italy was expected and
anxiously looked for by all the inhabitants from the emperor
downwards. They had accepted, though they heartily
disliked, the Union, and they consoled themselves with the
belief that in return the pope and other Western rulers
would at once send a fleet with soldiers and munitions of
war. It was generally believed in the city that the ships
were sent by the pope. Even where it was doubted, all
agreed that the arrival of additional fighting men for the
defence of the walls was of supreme importance. Nor were
the Turks less interested. They, too, expected and feared
the arrival of ships from the West, and, in addition to their
objection to Italian ships, they had already learned the
value of Genoese and Venetian soldiers for the defence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ships arrive at mouth of Bosporus.</div>

<p>When, about April 15, a south wind blew, the Genoese
weighed their anchors and made sail for the Dardanelles. On
their way they fell in with an imperial transport under
Flatanelas which had come from Sicily laden with corn.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a>
On the second day the wind became stronger and carried
the four ships through the straits and into the Marmora.
At about ten o’clock on the morning of April 20, their
crews saw in the distance the dome of Hagia Sophia.</p>

<p>When the Genoese ships were first seen, most of the
vessels of the Turkish fleet were anchored in the bay of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>Dolmabagshe at the Double Columns. But the Turkish
ships on the look-out at the entrance of the Bosporus appear
to have observed the approaching vessels as soon as the
watchmen in the city itself. They would also be seen
by a portion of the Turkish army encamped outside the
landward walls.</p>

<p>Upon the report of their coming the sultan himself
galloped at once to his fleet, about two miles distant from
his camp, and gave orders to the renegade Baltoglu to
proceed with his vessels to meet the ships, to capture them
if possible, but at any cost to prevent them passing the boom
and entering the harbour of the Golden Horn. If he could
not do that, he was told not to come back alive.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkish fleet resists.</div>

<p>The four ships desired to pass the boom; the object of
the Turkish fleet was to prevent them. Taking the lowest
estimate of the number of the Turkish vessels sent against
them, it was apparently hopeless that four ships dependent
on the wind should be able to hold their own against a fleet
of not less than a hundred and forty-five vessels so completely
under control as that of Baltoglu, which contained
triremes, biremes, and galleys. These Turkish ships, triremes,
galleys, and even transports, were crowded with the
best-equipped men of the army, including a body of
archers and men heavily clad with helmets and breastplates:
in short, with as many of the sultan’s best men
as could be placed on board. Shields and bucklers were
arranged around the larger galleys so as to form a breastwork
of armour against arrows and javelins; while on some
of the boats the rude culverins of the period were ranged
so as to bring them to bear against the four ships.</p>

<p>Then, after these hasty preparations, the Turkish fleet
proceeded in battle array down the Bosporus to Seraglio
Point and the Marmora. Captains and crews went out with
confidence of an easy victory. The fight was to be against
only four ships, and, with such overpowering superiority
in numbers of skilled fighters, who could doubt of success?
The admiral, says Critobulus, believed that he had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Genoese already in his hand. Barbaro notes the shouts of
delight with which the enemy came forward to the attack,
the noise of their many oars, and the sound of their
trumpets. ‘They came on,’ he says, ‘like men who intended
to win.’<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>The archbishop, another spectator, notes also that the
Turkish fleet advanced with every sign of joy, with the
beating of drums, and the clanging of trumpets. Phrantzes,
a third eye-witness, was specially impressed with the confidence
with which the Turkish flotilla approached. They
went on to meet the Genoese ships, he says, with drums and
horns, believing that they could intercept them without
difficulty. The wind being against them, sails were
dispensed with, but as their progress was independent of
wind the whole fleet advanced steadily to capture the foe.</p>

<p>Meantime the four ships kept on a direct course, steering
for and striving to pass the tower of ‘Megademetrius’ at
the Acropolis and to enter the Golden Horn.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> As they
sail along with a stiff south breeze behind them and
keeping, as vessels usually keep on making for the Golden
Horn with a southerly wind, well out from the land until
they reach the Point, their progress is easily seen by the
citizens. Many of them crowd the walls or climb the roofs
of houses near the seashore, while others hasten to the
Sphendone of the Hippodrome,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> where they have a wide
view of the Marmora and the entrance of the Bosporus.</p>

<p>Meantime the strong southerly wind has brought the
four ships abreast of the city. Their short but sturdy
hulls with high bows and loftier poops are driven steadily
through the water by the big swelling mainsails of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>the period. As they approach the Straits, when they are
well in view from the Sphendone, they are met by the
Turkish admiral who from the poop of his trireme commands
them peremptorily to lower their sails. On their
<span class="sidenote">Fight commences.</span>
refusal he gives orders for attack. The leading boats pull
for the ships, but both the advantages of wind and a considerable
sea were with the larger vessels, while their greater
height from the water made boarding under the circumstances
extremely difficult. The Italians with axes and
boathooks make short work of any who attempt it. The
skirmish became a running fight in which the attackers shot
their arrows and fire-bearing darts and threw their lances
with little effect.</p>

<p>The south wind continuing to blow, the ships held on
their course until they entered the Bosporus and came near
<span class="sidenote">Wind drops.</span>Seraglio Point. Then, all of a sudden, the wind fell,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> and
in a few minutes the sails flap idly under the very walls of
the Acropolis.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p>

<p>The sudden fall of the wind had shifted the advantage of
the position from the ships to the Turkish fleet. Then,
indeed, says Pusculus, the real fight commenced. The
Turkish admiral had apparently now complete justification
for the belief that he would have an easy capture. The
four ships were powerless to move, while Baltoglu could
choose his own mode of attack by his hundred and fifty
fighting vessels. When, while the ships were under the
walls of the Acropolis, the wind fell, they would nevertheless
drift over towards the Galata shore of the Bosporus by the
current which after a south wind invariably sets in that
direction. Probably they would be influenced also by the
last puffs which usually follow the sudden dropping of the
south wind near Constantinople. The remainder of the
combat is therefore to be fought at the mouth of the Golden
Horn, between Seraglio Point and the shore east of Galata
near Tophana, and just outside the walls of that city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>Thousands of spectators had gathered to witness this
second portion of the fight. The walls at Seraglio Point
were crowded with soldiers and citizens fearing for the
result but unable to render assistance. Nor could any aid
be given by the crews of the ships of the imperial fleet
which were near at hand on guard at the boom, though of
course on the harbour side. At one time, says Phrantzes,
the ships were within a stone’s-throw of the land. On the
opposite shore of the Golden Horn outside the walls of
Galata, to which attackers and attacked were slowly drifting
as they fought, the sultan and his suite watched the fight
with interest not less keen than that of the Christians on
the walls of Constantinople, but with the same confidence of
success as was felt by the admiral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack at mouth of Golden Horn.</div>

<p>A general attack was preceded by the order of Baltoglu
to surround the becalmed ships. After the fleet had been
disposed so as to act simultaneously, the order was given to
begin the fight but, apparently, not to close in on the ships.
Stone cannon-balls were discharged by the Turks and lances
with lighted material were thrown so as to set fire to the
sails or cordage. But the crews of the vessels attacked
knew their business thoroughly. They easily extinguished
the fire. From their turrets on the masts and their poops
and lofty bows they threw their lances, shot their arrows,
and hurled stones on the Turks unceasingly, and Baltoglu
soon found that this method of attack was useless. Thereupon
he shouted the order at the top of his voice for all the
vessels to advance and board. The admiral himself selected
for his special task the imperial transport as the largest of
the four ships. He ran his trireme’s bow against her poop
and tried to board her. For between two and three hours&mdash;that
is, so long as the fight endured&mdash;he stuck to her like the
stubborn Bulgarian he was, and never let go. The crews of
the other Turkish vessels hooked on to the anchors, seized
on everything by which they could hold, and attempted on
all sides to reach the decks of the ships. While some tried
to climb on board, others endeavoured to cut the ropes with
their axes, and set the ships on fire. Showers of arrows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
javelins were directed against the Christian crews. The
Genoese fighters were in armour and were proof against
the small missiles. Everything had been anticipated by
them. Their tuns of water extinguished the burning brands,
and their heavy stones and even small barrels of water
dropped from above sank or disabled the boats of their
assailants. The axe-men on board ‘our ships’ chopped off
the hands or broke the heads of all men who succeeded in
getting near the deck. Meanwhile, as amid shouts and
yells and blasphemies one boat’s crew after another was
defeated, others pressed near to replace them, and the
Genoese had to recommence their struggle against fresh and
vigorous men.</p>

<p>While the fight was going on, the vessels were always
drifting across to the Galata shore.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> Five triremes attacked
one of the Genoese ships; thirty large caiques or fustae
tackled a second, and the remaining Genoese was surrounded
by forty transports or parandaria filled with well-armed
soldiers. The fight continued with great fury. The sea
seemed covered with struggling ships. An enormous
number of darts, arrows, and other missiles were thrown.
The quantity of the latter, says Ducas, with pardonable
exaggeration, was so great that after a while the oars could
not be properly worked. The sea, says Barbaro, could
hardly be seen, on account of the great number of the
Turkish boats.</p>

<p>All this time the imperial ship commanded by Flatanelas,
with the Turkish admiral’s ship always holding on to her,
was defending herself bravely. Though Baltoglu would
not let go, the other attacking vessels which passed under
her bow were driven off with earthen pots full of Greek
fire and with stones.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> The slaughter around her was great.
For a time, indeed, the aim of the admiral and the energy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>of the attack seem to have been concentrated on the
capture of the imperial ship. Chalcondylas declares that
she would have been taken had it not been for the help
which the Genoese were able to give her; and Leonard also
says that she was protected by ‘ours’&mdash;that is, by the
Genoese ships. Probably it was in consequence of the risk
which the imperial ship had run of being captured that
presently the whole four lashed themselves together, so
that, in the words of Pusculus, they appeared to move like
four towers.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> Each of the four ships, however, remained
during the protracted battle a centre of attack in which the
triremes took the most important positions, grappling them
and being themselves supported by the smaller boats.</p>

<p>The fight was seen and every incident noted by the
friends alike of attackers and attacked from the opposite
sides of the Golden Horn. ‘We, watching from the walls
what passed, raised our prayers to God that He would have
mercy upon us.’<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Flatanelas, the captain of the imperial
ship, was observed on his deck fighting like a lion and
urging his men to follow his example. It was followed
both by his officers and by those on board the Genoese ships.
Nothing whatever occurred to show that they lost courage
for an instant. The attack on the ships was apparently no
nearer success than when it began. The spectators on both
sides had seen ships and fleet drifting towards the Galata
shore, and the citizens were aware that Mahomet with his
staff was watching the fierce struggle. This shore contains
a wide strip of level ground which has been silted up
during the last few centuries and is now built upon, but
which, like the corresponding low-lying ground outside the
walls of Constantinople on the opposite side of the Golden
Horn, either did not exist four centuries ago or was in part
covered with shallow water.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> Into the shallow water the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>sultan urged his horse in his excitement until his long robe
trailed in it. He went out as far as was possible towards
his vessels, in order to make himself seen and heard. When
he saw his large fleet and thousands of chosen men unable
to capture the four ships and again and again repulsed, his
anger knew no bounds. Roused to fury, he shouted and
gnashed his teeth. He hurled curses at the admiral and
his crews at the top of his voice. He declared they were
women, were fools and cowards, and no doubt let loose a
number not only of curses and blasphemies, as the archbishop
says, but of those opprobrious expressions in which
the Turkish language is exceptionally rich. The sultan’s
followers were not less disappointed and indignant than
Mahomet. They, too, cursed those in the fleet, and many
of them followed him into the water and rode towards the
ships.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkish ships defeated and retreat.</div>

<p>Urged by the presence and reproaches of their great
leader, the Turkish captains made one more desperate effort.
For very shame, says Phrantzes, they turned their bows
against our ships and fought fiercely. Pusculus says that
Mahomet, watching from the shore, inflamed their fury.
But all was in vain. The Genoese and the imperial ship
held their own, repelled every attempt to board them, and
did such slaughter among the Turks that it was with difficulty
the latter could withdraw some of their galleys.</p>

<p>The later portion of the fight had lasted upwards of two
hours; the sun was already setting, and the four ships had
been powerless to move on account of the calm. But the
fight was unequal, and they must have been destroyed, says
Critobulus, plausibly enough, if the battle had continued
under such conditions. In this extremity suddenly there
came a strong puff of wind. The sails filled, and the
ships once more had the advantage of being able to move.
They crashed triumphantly through the oars of the galleys
and the boats, shook off their assailants, and cleared them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>selves
a path. If at that time the whole fleet of the
barbarians, says Ducas, had barred the way, the Genoese
ships were capable of driving through and defeating it.
Thus, at the moment when the fight was the most critical,
they were able to sail away and take refuge under the walls
of the city. The wind had saved them. <i>Deus afflavit, et
dissipati sunt.</i></p>

<p>The battle was lost, but the sultan once again shouted
out orders to the admiral. Ducas suggests that Baltoglu
pretended not to hear, because Mahomet, being ignorant of
ships and sailing, gave absurd orders. There was, however,
no longer any hope of success, and night coming on, the
command was again given, and this time heard by Baltoglu,
to withdraw to the Double Columns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genoese ships brought inside harbour.</div>

<p>Barbaro, who was in the city, describes how he himself
took part in bringing the four gallant vessels inside the
boom. When it became dark, he accompanied Gabriel
Trevisano with the latter’s two galleys, and Zacharia Grione
with his one, and with them went outside the boom. Fearing
that they would be attacked, they did their utmost to
make it appear that their fleet was large. They had three
trumpets for each of the two galleys, and with these they
made as much noise as if they had at least twenty galleys.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the night the Turks thought their
fleet was about to be attacked, and remained at anchor on
the defensive. The four ships were safely towed within the
boom and into the port of Constantinople, to the indescribable
delight of Greeks and Italians alike.</p>

<p>The Turks were possibly hindered in the fight by their
numerical superiority. The oars of their galleys were broken;
one boat got into the way of others, while in the confusion
every bolt or arrow shot from the ships told upon the crowded
masses of men in the enemy’s vessels below them. Many
in the triremes were suffocated or trampled under foot.
Every attempt to board either of the ships had failed. The
losses suffered by the Turks were undoubtedly severe, though
exaggerated by the victors. A few of their boats were captured
or destroyed. The archbishop declares that he learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
from the spies that nearly ten thousand had been killed;
Phrantzes, that he heard from the Turks themselves that
more than twelve thousand of these ‘Sons of Hagar’ perished
in the sea alone. The version of Critobulus is the most
likely to be correct. He gives the killed as upwards of a
hundred, and the wounded as above three hundred.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> The
losses on board the four ships were not altogether slight.
Phrantzes declares that no Christians were killed in the
battle, though two or three who were wounded ‘departed
after some days to the Lord;’ while Critobulus gives a much
more probable story of twenty-two killed, and half the crews
wounded.</p>

<p>All writers agree that the fight was manfully sustained
on both sides. The ships lay on the water without a breath
of wind, though there was probably a slight swell. It was
a small but brilliant sea fight of the old type between skilled
sailors and skilled soldiers, in which the latter were unable
to gain any advantage over their opponents fighting on their
own element, and had to withdraw humbled and defeated.</p>

<p>The disappointment and rage of the sultan were great and
not unnatural.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkish admiral degraded.</div>

<p>The unfortunate admiral was brought next day before
him and reproached as a traitor. Mahomet asked him how
he could expect to capture the fleet in the harbour since he
could not even take four ships, upbraided him for his inactivity
and cowardice, and declared that he was ready himself
to behead him.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> The admiral pleaded that from the beginning
to the end of the fight his own ship had never quitted
its hold upon the poop of the largest vessel, and that he and
his crew had fought on uninterruptedly until recalled. The
Turkish officers also spoke on his behalf, testified to his
courage and tenacity, and called attention to the severe
wound on his eye accidentally inflicted by one of his men.
The sultan, after some hesitation, consented to spare his
life, but ordered him to be bastinadoed.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> As a further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>punishment, he was deprived of all his honours, and whatever
he possessed was given to the Janissaries.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p>The success raised the hopes of the besieged, because they
now firmly believed that these ships were only the forerunners
of many others which were on their way to save the city.
They had not yielded to Rome for nothing, and aid would
come, and the city would yet be saved. In truth, a new
crusade was not necessary to secure its deliverance. A few
more vessels sent by the Christian states, with an army one
tenth or even one twentieth of the number of the soldiers
of the cross who had passed by Constantinople under
Godfrey, would have been enough to prevent the conquest of
the city by Mahomet. No further aid, however, came. All
the hopes based upon re-union proved illusory, and Hungarians
as well as Italians failed to render the assistance
which might have been of first importance to their own
interests.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack contemporaneously made in Lycus valley.</div>

<p>The fight with the four ships was on April 20. During
that day the great bombards had been hard at work along
the landward walls, and especially near the Romanus Gate.
The sultan himself was absent on the following day at the
Double Columns, superintending one of the most interesting
operations connected with the siege, but the bombardment
went on as if he had been present. An important tower known
as the Bactatinian, near the Romanus Gate,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> was destroyed
on the 21st, with a portion of the adjacent Outer Wall, and,
says Barbaro, it was only through the mercy of Jesus Christ
that the Turks did not give general battle, or they would
have got into the city. He adds that if they had attacked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>with even ten thousand men, no one could have hindered their
entry. The Moscovite, speaking of the same incident, states
that the Turks were so infuriated by a successful shot from
the small cannon of Justiniani that Mahomet gave the order
for an assault, raised the cry of ‘<i>Jagma, jagma!</i>’ ‘Pillage,
pillage!’ but they were repulsed. One of the balls, according
to the same author, knocked away five of the battlements
and buried itself in the walls of a church.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> The defenders,
among whom, notes Barbaro, were some ‘of our Venetian
gentlemen,’ set themselves at once to make stout repairs
where the wall had been broken down. Barrels full of stones,
beams, logs, anything that would help to make a barricade,
were hastily got together and worked with clay and earth,
so as to form a substitute for the Outer Wall. When completed,
the new work formed a stockade, made largely of wood
and built up with earth and stones.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> The ‘accursed Turk,’
says Barbaro, did not cease day and night to fire his greatest
bombard against the walls near which the repairs were being
made. Arrows and stones innumerable were thrown, and
there were discharges also from firelocks or fusils<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> which
threw leaden balls. He adds that during these days the
enemy were in such numbers that it was hardly possible to
see the ground or anything else except the white head dress
of the Janissaries, and the red fezes of the rest of the Turks.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></p>

<p>Meantime the sultan was bent upon carrying into execution
a plan for obtaining access to the harbour.</p>

<p>All accounts agree that the defeat of the Turkish fleet
on April 20 had roused Mahomet to fury. More than one
contemporary states that it was the immediate cause of
Mahomet’s decision to attempt to gain possession of the
<span class="sidenote">Transport of Turkish ships overland.</span>
Golden Horn by the transport of his ships over land across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>the peninsula of Galata. The statement may well be
doubted, but the failure to capture the four ships probably
hastened the execution of a project already formed, and,
like all his plans, carefully concealed until the moment for
action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons for such project.</div>

<p>The reasons which urged Mahomet to try to gain
entrance to the Golden Horn were principally three: to
weaken the defence at the landward walls, to exercise
control over the Genoese of Galata, and to facilitate the
communications with his base at Roumelia-Hissar. So long
as he was excluded, the enemy had only two sides of the
triangular-shaped city to defend; whereas if the Turkish ships
could range up alongside the walls on the side of the Horn
the army within the city, already wretchedly inadequate for
the defence on the landward and Marmora sides, would
have to be weakened by the withdrawal of men necessary to
guard the newly attacked position.</p>

<p>The possession of the Horn would enable Mahomet to
exercise a dominant influence over Galata. This was a
matter of great importance, because at any time the hostility
of the Genoese might have enormously increased the difficulties
of the siege and probably have compelled him to raise
it. There were, indeed, already signs that Genoese sentiment
was unfriendly to him.</p>

<p>The position of the Genoese in Galata was a singular
one. The city was entirely theirs and under their government.
It was surrounded by strong walls which were built on the
slope of the steep hill and with those on the side of the
Golden Horn formed a large but irregular triangle. The
highest position in the city was crowned by the noble tower
still existing, and then known as the Tower of Christ.
Constantinople and Galata were each interested in keeping
the splendid natural harbour closed. Behind Galata&mdash;that
is, immediately behind the walls of the city&mdash;the heights and
all the back country were held by the Turks.</p>

<p>Like most neutrals, the people of Galata were accused by
each of the combatants of giving aid to the other side.
The archbishop, himself a Genoese by origin, is loud in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
complaints against his countrymen for having preferred their
interests to their duty as Christians. But it is abundantly
clear that the Genoese continued to trade with their neighbours
across the Golden Horn. Whether the balance of
services rendered to the combatants was in favour of the
Greeks or of Mahomet may be doubtful, but there was no
doubt in Mahomet’s mind, or probably in that of any one
else, that the sympathy of the Genoese, as shown by their
conduct, was with their fellow Christians. The Genoese
ships with which the fight had just taken place were safe
once they had passed the boom and had come under the
protection of the Genoese on one side and the Greeks on the
other. The Golden Horn was thus a refuge for all ships
hostile to the Turks.</p>

<p>It was necessary to give the Podestà and the Council of
Galata a lesson. But Mahomet had tried and failed to force
the boom. Nor could he obtain possession of the end
which was within boundaries of Galata.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> To have made
the attempt would have been to make war on the Genoese.
But their walls were strong, their defenders brave, and the first
rumour of an attack upon the city would be the signal for the
despatch of the whole Genoese fleet and of all the forces that
the suzerain lord of Galata, the duke of Milan, could muster for
their aid. Moreover, within the harbour there were between
twenty and thirty large fighting ships, and the sea fight had
now shown clearly how very much his difficulties would be
increased if he forced the Genoese into open hostilities against
him.</p>

<p>The third reason why Mahomet wanted command of
the harbour was to secure his own communications. His
important division of troops under Zagan Pasha occupied
the northern shore of the Golden Horn beyond Galata,
together with the heights above the city. While it was
necessary to hold this position so as to keep in touch with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>his fleet at the Double Columns and his fortresses at
Roumelia-Hissar, the only means of communication between
the main body of his troops encamped before the walls and
those under Zagan was the distant and dangerous ford
over the upper portion of the Golden Horn at Kiat-Hana,
then called Cydaris. Once Mahomet obtained possession of
the harbour he could without interruption build a bridge
over the upper end of the Golden Horn by which communications
between the two divisions of his army would be
greatly facilitated.</p>

<p>To accomplish these three objects Mahomet judged that
his wisest course was to let the Genoese severely alone and
to attempt to obtain possession of the harbour by a method
which should not force the neutrals to become open enemies.
He resolved to accomplish the difficult feat of transporting
a fleet overland from the Bosporus to the Horn. This feat
may have been suggested to him by a Venetian who, fourteen
years earlier, had seen one of a similar kind performed,
in which his fellow citizens had transported a number of
ships from the Adige to Lake Garda.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></p>

<p>The sultan’s entire command of the country behind Galata
would enable him to make his preparations possibly without
even the knowledge of the Genoese. The ridge of hills now
occupied by Pera was covered partly with vineyards and
partly with bushes. The western slope, from the ridge
along which runs the Grande Rue de Péra, down to the
‘Valley of the Springs,’ now known as Cassim Pasha, was
used as a Genoese graveyard, and is still covered by the
cypress trees that mark the Turkish cemetery which took its
place. There existed a path from a place on the Bosporus
near the present Tophana to The Springs at right angles to
the road on the ridge of Pera Hill, the two roads forming a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>cross and thus giving to Pera its modern Greek name of
Stavrodromion. This path followed the natural valley, now
forming the street by the side of which is erected the church
which is a memorial to British soldiers and sailors who
perished in the Crimean war, and then crossing the ridge
on a flat tableland over a few hundred yards descended in
almost a straight line by another valley which is also
preserved by a street to The Springs and the waters of the
Golden Horn. It was probably along this route that the
sultan had determined to haul his ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Project not formed hastily.</div>

<p>It is impossible to believe that Mahomet had arrived
hastily at his decision to accomplish this serious engineering
feat. In accordance with his usual habit, he would guard
his design with the utmost secrecy. At the same time, he
would push on his preparations with his customary energy.
The timber needed for making a species of tramway, for
rollers and for ship cradles, had been carefully and secretly
amassed and everything was ready for execution when the
leader gave the word. The plan and execution was a great
surprise, not only to the Greeks, but even to the people
of Galata. That the plan and preparations were conceived
and completed in a single day or night is incredible.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet diverts attention from project.</div>

<p>If this conjecture is correct, Zagan, who was in command
of the Turks behind Galata and at the head of the Golden
Horn, would have been able to prevent the preparations from
becoming known. Possibly it was in order to conceal the
final arrangements that the sultan, a few days previously,
had brought his guns or bombards to bear on the ships
which were moored to the boom, while Baltoglu, as we have
seen, was attacking them from the sea. These guns were
stationed on the hill of St. Theodore, northward of the
eastern wall of Galata.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> At daylight on April 21, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>them opened fire. The discharge of cannon was continued
and would divert attention from what was going on behind
the Galata walls. The first shot caused great alarm. The
ball, followed by dense black smoke, went over the houses of
the Genoese and made them fear that the city itself was
about to be attacked. The second shot rose to a great distance,
fell upon one of the ships at the boom, smashed a hole
in it and sank it, killing some of the crew. The effect upon
the crews of the other ships was for the moment to cause
consternation. They, however, soon placed themselves out
of range. The Turks continued to fire, though the balls fell
short, and, according to Leonard, this fire was continued
during the day. A hundred cannon-balls were discharged;
many houses in Galata were struck and a woman was killed.
The Genoese were thus decoyed into paying no attention to
what was going on behind their city. During all the same
day, Barbaro records that the bombardment against the San
Romano walls was exceptionally heavy, and even during the
night, according to Michael the Janissary, all the batteries
directed against the Constantinople landward walls were
kept hard at work. This, too, was probably intended to
divert attention from the preparations for the immediate
transport of the fleet.</p>

<p>These measures for diverting attention account for the
passage of the ships not being generally known, if, indeed, it
was known at all by any of the enemy, until it was accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a>
For this reason no attempt was made to destroy
them either before they were placed on land or as they
reached the water. At the same time, Mahomet, who seldom
neglected a precaution, had made preparations to repel any
attempt made to oppose the transit.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>In the evening of the 21st or on the morning of the 22nd
everything appears to have been prepared for the remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>overland voyage of the sultan’s fleet. Between seventy and
eighty vessels had been selected from those anchored in the
Bosporus.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>A road had been carefully levelled, probably following
the route already indicated, from a spot near the present
Tophana to the valley of The Springs. Stout planks or logs
had been laid upon it. A great number of rollers had been
prepared of six pikes, or about thirteen or fourteen feet, long.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a>
Logs and rollers were thoroughly greased and made ready
for their burdens. The ships’ cradles, to the side of which
poles were fixed so as to enable the ships to be securely
fastened, were lowered into the water to receive the vessels
which were then floated upon them, and by means of long
cables were pulled ashore and started on their voyage.</p>

<p>A preliminary trial was made with a small fusta, and this
having been successfully handled, the Turks began to transport
<span class="sidenote">Transport of eighty ships overland.</span>
others. Some were hauled by mere hand power, others
required the assistance of pulleys, while buffaloes served to
haul the remainder. The multitude of men at the sultan’s
disposal enabled the ships to start on their voyage in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>The strangeness and the oddity of the spectacle, the
paradox of ships journeying over land, seems to have impressed
the Turks, who always have a keen relish for fun, as
much as did the ingenuity of the plan. The whole business
had indeed its ludicrous aspect. The men took their
accustomed places in the vessel. The sails were unfurled as
if the ships were putting out to sea. The oarsmen got out
their oars and pulled as if they were on the water. The
leaders ran backwards and forwards on the central gangway or
<i>histodokè</i> where the mast when not hoisted usually rested,
to see that they all kept stroke together. The helmsmen
were at their posts, while fifes and drums sounded as
if the boats were in the water. The display thus made,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>accompanied as it was by cheering and music, may probably
be attributed rather to the desire of keeping every one
in good humour than to the belief that such a disposal of
the men could facilitate the transport of the vessels.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

<p>The vessels followed each other up the hill in rapid
succession, and amid shouting and singing and martial
music were hauled up the steep ridge to the level portion
which is now the Grande Rue de Pera, a height of two
hundred and fifty feet from the level of the Bosporus. A
short haul of about a furlong upon level ground enabled
them to begin the descent to the Golden Horn, and so
rapidly was this performed that before the last ship had
reached the ridge the first was afloat in the harbour. The
distance is described by Critobulus as not less than eight
stadia. Taking the stadium as a furlong or slightly less,
this is a correct estimate of the distance over which these
ships travelled, if the ships started, as I have suggested, from
the present Tophana. Nor is there reason to doubt the statement
that the traject was made, as many contemporaries
assert, in one night.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantine alleged to have asked for peace.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ducas</span> relates that about this time, when the emperor found
that the walls which had resisted the Arabs and other invaders
were not strong enough to support the attack of
Mahomet’s cannon, he sent an offer to pay any amount of
tribute which might be imposed on condition that the siege
should be abandoned.</p>

<p>His narrative would imply that the offer was made
immediately after the transport of the fleet overland.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<p>Mahomet replied to the emperor that it was too late: that
he meant to obtain the city or die in the attempt. He,
however, made a counter proposal. If the emperor would
leave it, he would give him the Morea, would appoint his
brother to rule over other provinces, and thus sultan and
emperor might live at peace with each other. If this
counter proposal were rejected, he declared his intention of
putting the emperor and all his nobles to the sword, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>allowing his soldiers to take captive the people and to
pillage their houses. He himself would be content with the
deserted city. Ducas adds that of course the offer of
Mahomet was refused, because in what place could the
emperor have appeared without meeting the scorn, not only
of all Christians, but of Jews and even of the Turks themselves?
This proposal is not mentioned by Phrantzes.
Gibbon suggests that he is silent regarding it because he
wished to spare his prince even the thought of a surrender.
Ducas, however, is constantly inaccurate, and it may well be
that he was merely relating an unfounded report which was
current after the capture of the city, when he himself was
but a boy. It is difficult to believe that if any proposal of
the kind had been made at the time indicated it would not
have been known to Leonard, Barbaro, Pusculus, Tetaldi,
or others who were present at the siege, and if known that
it would not have been mentioned. Phrantzes, writing in
defence of the emperor, says that it is certain that he could
have fled from the city if he had so desired and that he deliberately
preferred the fate of the Good Shepherd who is
ready to lay down his life for his sheep.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> The same
testimony is borne by Critobulus,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> who says that although
Constantine realised the peril which threatened the city,
and although he could have saved his own life as many
counselled him to do, yet he refused, and preferred to die
rather than see the city captured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts to destroy Turkish ships in harbour.</div>

<p class="tb">The sudden appearance of the seventy or eighty ships in
the inner harbour of the Golden Horn caused consternation
in the city. Every one could understand that if this fleet
were not destroyed, the number of men available for the
defence of the landward walls must be very greatly
lessened. Moreover, the walls now for the first time
requiring defence were low and required constant watching.
A bridge or pontoon was already in course of construction
in the upper part of the Horn beyond the city walls, the use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>of which was now evident as a means of attacking the
harbour walls.</p>

<p>A meeting was hastily called with the consent of the
Venetian bailey, and perhaps by him, at which twelve men
who had trust in each other were present. Among them
was John Justiniani, who had already acquired the confidence
not merely of his countrymen and of the emperor but of
the Venetians. They met in the church of St. Mary,
probably in the Venetian quarter near the present Rustem
Pasha mosque, to decide upon the best measures for the
destruction of the Turkish ships which had been so strangely
carried over Pera Hill.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> Various proposals were made. It
was suggested that the Christian ships in the harbour should
make a combined attack upon the Turkish vessels. It was
objected that the consent of the Genoese at Galata would be
required, and they were known to be unwilling to declare open
war against Mahomet. In any case, precious time would
be lost in obtaining their consent. The second proposal was
to destroy the Turkish guns which had been placed on the
western side of Galata to protect the ships, and then to
attempt to burn the vessels. This was evidently a dangerous
operation, because Zagan Pasha had a detachment of
troops in the neighbourhood and the Venetians and Greeks
were not sufficiently numerous to risk the loss of a body of
<span class="sidenote">Plan decided upon.</span>
men upon such an expedition. The third proposal was the
one which finally commended itself to the meeting. If not
made it was at least strongly supported by James Coco, the
captain of a Trebizond galley, a man whom Phrantzes
describes as more capable of action than of speech.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> His
project was, without delay, without consulting the Genoese,
to make a dash and burn the Turkish ships in Cassim Pasha
Bay. He himself offered to undertake the task.</p>

<p>The meeting had been quietly called, and no time had
been lost in arriving at a decision. It was of the very
essence of Coco’s proposal that it should be executed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>immediately and that it should be kept secret. His preparations
were forthwith put in hand. He chose two transports
of five hundred tons each and placed bales of cotton
and of wool upon them as armour to prevent damage from
cannon-balls. Two large galleys and two of the lighter and
swifter kinds of biremes or fustae were to accompany them.
Each fusta had twenty-four banks or thwarts and contained
seventy-two oarsmen, forty-eight abaft the mast and twenty-four
ahead of it. Accompanying each ship was a large
boat.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> Coco’s plan was to employ the two large ships as a
screen for the galleys and fustae, so that at the last moment
these swift vessels might pull rapidly forward and cut out
or burn the Turkish ships.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the vessels should be brought together
that same night of April 24, at an hour after sunset, the
Eastern method of computing the hours making this a fixed
and precise time, and the attack was to be made at midnight.
The Genoese heard of the proposed attack and pressed
<span class="sidenote">Execution postponed till April 28.</span>
the Venetians hard to postpone the execution of the project,
in order that they might take part in it. Unluckily, they
consented. The preparations of the Genoese took four days.
During that period the sultan became aware of what was
proposed, added two big guns to those already stationed on
the shore at Cassim Pasha to cover his ships, and waited in
confidence for the attack.</p>

<p>Contemporary writers charge the Genoese with having
betrayed the project to the sultan. Even Leonard evidently
believed in the existence of this treachery and hints that he
knows more than he cares to tell. Ducas states bluntly
that the Genoese told the sultan. Critobulus and Pusculus
each affirm that Mahomet had information from Galata.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a>
Barbaro adds the further detail that the Podestà, as the
mayor of Galata was called, on learning what was proposed
to be done, immediately sent word to the sultan at St.
Romanus Gate, and speaks of the ‘accursed Genoese’ as
‘enemies of the faith and treacherous dogs’ for so doing.</p>

<p>While it is difficult to reject all these statements, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>must be remembered that the cry of treachery is usually
raised in similar cases when things go wrong, and, as the
preparations must have been known to a great many people,
it would have been wonderful indeed if Mahomet had not
learned what so many knew.</p>

<p>In whatever manner the information was acquired, it
cannot be doubted that the Turks had knowledge of the
project, and that the Greeks and Venetians were not aware
that it was known to the common enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt made to destroy Turkish ships.</div>

<p>By April 28 everything was ready. Two hours before
dawn the two ships with their bales of cotton and wool left
the harbour of Galata&mdash;that is, the north-eastern portion of
the Golden Horn. They were accompanied by the galleys,
one under Trevisano and the other under Zacharia Grione.
Both captains were experienced and brave men. Trevisano
was the captain who had placed himself at the service of
the emperor ‘per honor de Dio et per honor di tuta la
Christianitade.’ Three swift fustae, each with well-armed
and picked men and materials for burning the Turkish fleet,
accompanied them. The leading one was commanded by
Coco, who had chosen the crew from his own galley. A
number of small boats carrying gunpowder and combustibles
were to follow. The order was given, as previously arranged,
that the ships should go first and the galleys and biremes
follow under their shelter. When the expedition started,
some at least were surprised to see a bright light flare up
from the top of Galata Tower, which was probably rightly
judged to be a signal to the Turks that the ships were
leaving.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> Everything was still in profound darkness and no
sign or sound came from the Turkish ships to indicate that
they were on the alert. While the Christian ships were
pulled slowly and silently along, Coco, in his swift fusta, grew
impatient at their slow progress. Naturally, says Barbaro,
the ships with only forty rowers could not go so fast as did
his fusta, which had seventy-two; and, greedy of glory, he
drew ahead of them in order that he might have the satisfaction
of being first to attack and of being the destroyer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>the Turkish fleet. Then suddenly the silence was broken
and the Turks showed they were prepared. Their cannon
opened fire and Coco’s fusta was struck, but without being
much damaged. A minute or two afterwards, however, a
better aimed shot hit his vessel, going in at one side, and
out at the other.</p>

<p>Before you could have said ten paternosters she had sunk.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>
The survivors of his crew were swimming with their light
armour and in the darkness for their lives. Many perished,
and among them Coco himself. Meantime the guns were
directed against the ships. The enemy fired from a short
distance and Barbaro tells us that though they could hear
the mocking laughter of their foes, they were unable, on
account of the darkness and the smoke arising from the
cannon and the smouldering cotton and wool of their own
ships, to render any assistance. By the time, indeed, the
other vessels had come up, the Turks had all their guns
in full play and the vessels had enough to do to look
after their own safety. Trevisano’s ship, as probably the
largest of the galleys, was signalled for attack. Two shots
struck and went through her. She half filled with water
and had to be deserted, Trevisano and most of his men
taking to the water to save their lives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt fails.</div>

<p>Then the whole Turkish fleet of seventy or eighty
vessels put out to attack the other two ships. The Italians
and Greeks fought valiantly, probably expecting to be supported
by the rest of the Christian fleet, which, however, did
not arrive in time to give any aid. The fight was ‘terrible
et forte:’ there was, says Barbaro, ‘a veritable hell;’ missiles
and blows were countless, cannonading continual. The contest
raged furiously for a full hour and a half and neither of the
combatants could overcome the other. Thereupon both
retired. The two ships were not captured, and their crews
had once more maintained the superiority of the Christian
ships over a more numerous foe in smaller vessels.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>But the expedition had nevertheless failed. Eighty or
ninety of the best men, including many Venetians, had been
lost. Only one Turkish vessel had been destroyed. The
misfortune caused bitter grief to the Greeks and Latins.
The success of the Christian ships when attacked by the
Turks a few days earlier had led to the belief that on the
water at least they were invincible. The consternation and
even panic caused in the fleet by the failure was such that
if the Turks on that day had joined battle and taken the
offensive ‘we should all,’ says Barbaro, ‘without a doubt
have been captured, and even those who were on shore.’
The depression in the city was increased and turned to rage
by the conduct of Mahomet. Some of the sailors had swum
to the northern shore and were captured by the Turks.
<span class="sidenote">Murder of captives.</span>Forty of them were ostentatiously killed so that those
who a short while before had been their companions
witnessed their execution. Though one may blame the
<span class="sidenote">Reprisals.</span>
inhumanity of reprisals, one cannot, in the event which
followed, be surprised at them. A large number of Turkish
prisoners in the city were brought bound from prison and
were hanged on the highest part of the city walls opposite
Cassim Pasha, where the Christian prisoners had suffered.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Operations in Lycus Valley.</div>

<p class="tb">During these days the city walls on the landward side
had been the scene of constant attacks. The failure of the
first attempt, on the 18th, to pass the walls was followed by
steady firing day and night to destroy them. Probably on
April 23 the great cannon was removed to a position
opposite the Romanus Military gate, the place where
Justiniani was stationed, ‘because there the walls were the
least solid and very low.’<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> From this time it commenced
and never ceased to batter them.</p>

<p>The disadvantages resulting from the transport of the
Turkish ships into the harbour were at once felt. While
continual pounding from the great cannon and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>machines was going on at the landward walls and while
feints were being made which kept the defenders always on
the alert, to resist attacks or effect repairs, a portion of
their forces had to be told off to defend the north-western
walls facing the Golden Horn. Many attempts were made
from these walls on the Horn, and from the Christian ships
to destroy the Turkish vessels. Nearly every day as long as
the siege lasted, some of the Greek or Venetian ships were
told off to watch or attack them. Sometimes the Turks
were chased to the shore: at other times the pursuers became
the pursued.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Building of bridge over Upper Horn.</div>

<p>To enable his troops to pass readily across the Golden
Horn, Mahomet commenced and carried through with his
usual energy the construction of a bridge over the upper
part of it, near the place where the landward walls join
those on the side of the Horn. This district was then known
as Cynegion, and now as Aivan Serai.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> The bridge was
formed of upwards of a thousand wine barrels, all securely
fastened together with ropes. Two of the barrels placed
lengthways made the width of the bridge. Upon them
beams were fixed, and over the beams a planking sufficiently
wide to enable five soldiers to walk abreast with ease.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> The
object in placing the bridge so near the walls was, not
merely to facilitate communications between the troops
behind Pera and the army before the walls, but to attach to
it pontoons upon which cannon could be placed for attacking
the harbour walls.</p>

<p>The paucity of the number of the defenders greatly alarmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>the emperor and those around him who had gathered in
council to meet the new dangers. They were compelled to
recognise that this new point of attack, in the very place
where, and where alone, the city had formerly been captured,
required especial care, and accordingly they decided to send a
strong detachment of Greeks and Italians to the north-west
corner of the walls at Aivan Serai.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p>From the moment the Turks had gained entrance into
the inner harbour they never ceased to harass the city on
every side.</p>

<p>During the next few days the cannonading against the
walls was constant and the efforts to repair the damage
equally persistent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provisions running short at commencement of May.</div>

<p>Barbaro mentions that on May 1 or 2 it was found that
provisions were running short. The organisation for the
supply of food to the soldiers was defective, and many complained
that they had to leave the walls in order to earn
bread for their wives and families. This led to the formation
of what we may call a relief committee charged with
the distribution of provisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Skirmishes between ships and besieged.</div>

<p>On May 3, the besieged placed two of their largest guns
on the walls opposite the Turkish ships in the harbour.
The Turks replied by placing the two large cannons with
which Coco’s bireme had been attacked on the opposite
shore to attack the walls. The besieged persisted in their
endeavours to destroy the fleet. For a time they did more
damage than the Turks were able to effect, but the latter
brought other cannon and kept up their firing night and
day. For ten days, says Barbaro, Greeks and Turks fired
at each other, but without much result, ‘because our cannons
were inside the walls and theirs were well protected, and
moreover the distance between them was half an Italian
mile, and beyond the range of guns on either side.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 3: sending out of brigantine to find Venetian fleet.</div>

<p>Now that the siege had run into May the emperor and
the leaders were becoming alarmed at the non-arrival of the
Venetian fleet. The agreement with the Venetian bailey,
in conformity with which a fleet was to be sent at once to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>the aid of the city, had been concluded on January 26, and
no tidings had yet been heard of it. Its admiral, Loredano,
was known to be a brave man ‘who held strongly to the
Christian cause,’ but the fear was that he had not been
informed of the agreement. Accordingly, on May 3, the
emperor called together the notables of the Venetian colony
and his chief officers, and suggested that one of their swiftest
ships should be sent into the Archipelago and, if need be, as
far as Euboea to seek for the fleet and to press Loredano
to hasten to the relief of the city. Every one approved of
the suggestion, and the same day a swift-sailing brigantine,
manned only with twelve men, was made ready to sail.
The crew were disguised to make them look as much as
possible like Turks. At midnight the boom was opened.
The ship hoisted the Turkish flag and sailed away, passing
safely through the Marmora and the Dardanelles into the
Archipelago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proposal that Constantine should leave the city.</div>

<p>The author of the Moscovite chronicle, who was probably
present at the siege, declares that Constantine during these
days was urged by the patriarch and the nobles to leave the
city, that Justiniani himself recommended this course and
placed his ships at the emperor’s disposal for such purpose.
It was probably urged that he would be more likely to
defeat the Turks from outside than within the city; that,
though the number of men for the defence of the walls was
insufficient, the withdrawal of the emperor and a small retinue
would be of little consequence, but that, once outside, his
brother and other subjects would flock to his banner and he
could arrange with Iskender Bey for the despatch of an
Albanian army. In this manner time would be gained
during which the long looked-for ships and soldiers from
the West which the Venetians and the pope had promised,
and to which other princes were ready to contribute, could
arrive at Constantinople. Probably the presence of the
emperor, with even a small band, elsewhere threatening
the Turkish position would cause Mahomet to raise the
siege.</p>

<p>The emperor, says the same writer, listened quietly, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
touched by the proposal and shed tears; thanked the chiefs
for their advice, but declared that, while he recognised that
his departure might be of advantage to himself, he would
never consent to abandon the people, the clergy, the churches,
and his throne in such a moment of danger. ‘What,’ he
adds, ‘would the world say of me? Ask me to remain with
you. I am ready to die with you.’ It was probably on this
occasion that the emperor declared, as already mentioned,
that he preferred ‘to follow the example of the Good Shepherd
who lays down his life for his sheep.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">New attack on ships at boom, May 5.</div>

<p>Determined if possible to destroy the Christian fleet and
apparently caring very little about resistance from Galata,
the Turks placed two of their guns on the slope of Pera
Hill and on May 5 commenced once more to fire over the
corner of Galata at the ships lying at the boom. They took
care, however, according to Barbaro, to aim at the Venetian
vessels. Firing went on all day. A ball of two hundred
pounds weight struck a Genoese merchant ship of three
hundred tons burden, which was laden with a valuable
cargo of silk and other merchandise, and sank her. The
Turks continued firing all day long, and in consequence ships
left the boom and retired to the shelter of the Galata
walls.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> The Genoese went to complain to the Turkish
vizier of the unfriendly act of firing on and sinking one of
their vessels. They reminded him that they were neutrals
and were most anxious to preserve peace. According to
Ducas, they declared that if they had not been friendly, the
Turks would never have succeeded in transporting their
ships overland, as they, the Genoese, could have burnt them.
There are two versions of the reply given by the Turkish
leaders. According to Ducas, they pleaded that they did not
know that the owner of the sunken ship was a Genoese,
and believed it to belong to the enemy. They urged the
Genoese to wish them success in their efforts to capture the
city and promised, in such case, full compensation to the
owner of the sunken ship and cargo. According to
Phrantzes, the sultan himself answered that the ships were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>not merchant vessels but pirates. They had come to help
the enemy and must be treated as enemies. It is difficult
to decide which answer was given, but that recorded by
Ducas appears more in accord with the young sultan’s
crafty policy. Whichever is the correct version, the Genoese
had to profess their satisfaction with it.</p>

<p>The failure to destroy the Turkish ships, the increased
labour thrown on the Venetians within the city, and the
doubtful conduct of the Genoese, led to ill-feeling between
the citizens of the two republics which caused a disturbance
amounting to a serious riot within the city itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jealousy between Venetians and Genoese.</div>

<p>The traditional jealousy between Venetians and Genoese
was still formidable. In the present instance each accused
the other of not loyally defending Constantinople and of
being ready to send away their ships whenever they could
do so in safety. The Venetians replied to this accusation by
pointing out that they had unshipped the rudders from
many of their vessels and had deposited both them and the
sails within the city. The Genoese retorted that, though
they kept their rudders and sails on board ready for use at
any moment, they had their wives and children in Galata
and had not the slightest intention of abandoning so
excellent a situation. If they had advocated peace with the
Turks, it was at the desire of the emperor, with whom they
had a common interest. The reply was difficult to answer,
but carried no conviction to their rivals, because the
Venetians believed that, in spite of it, the Genoese were
acting solely to further their own interests. To the most
serious charge&mdash;that of giving notice to the Turks of the
attempt to burn their ships&mdash;the Genoese answered that the
plan had failed through the bad management of Coco, who,
with the object of gaining for himself alone the credit of
having destroyed the hostile fleet, had neglected necessary
precautions. Recrimination ran high and led to blows.
Phrantzes gives us a pathetic picture of the emperor appearing
among the rioters and imploring them to make friends.
War against the enemy was surely bad enough; he begged
them for the sake of God not to make war on each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
His influence was sufficient to restore order, but while the
hostile feeling was so far temporarily allayed as to make
Genoese and Venetians content during the siege to lay aside
their differences, it endured until the end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to capture city by assault on May 7 fails.</div>

<p>On May 7, an assault was commenced which the besieged
believed would be general by land and sea. On the previous
days the monotonous firing against the walls had been
constantly going on, and preparations had been noted as
being made in the fleet for some new movement. Four
hours after sunset thirty thousand Turks with scaling
ladders and everything necessary endeavoured to force an
entrance over the walls. The attempt lasted for three hours,
but the besieged resisted bravely and the Turks had to
retreat, having suffered, says Barbaro, much damage and, ‘I
should say, with a great many killed.’ The sailors on their
side were ready: the ships left the protection of the Galata
walls and moved once more to take up their positions in
defence of the boom, but the Turks did not come to the
attack, possibly, as Barbaro suggests, because they were
afraid of the Venetian ships.</p>

<p>The Moscovite mentions an encounter during this attack
between a Greek strategos or general named Rangebè and
a Turk named Amer Bey, the standard-bearer of the sultan.
The Greek made a sortie, put the followers of Amer to
flight, and then attacked Amer himself, whom he cut in
two. The Turks, furious at the loss, surrounded Rangebè and
killed him.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p>The next day the Venetian Council of Twelve decided
that Trevisano with his four hundred men should leave the
entrance to the harbour and take up the defence of the
newly threatened walls at Aivan Serai. There appears,
however, to have been considerable opposition on the part
of his crews, who preferred to remain afloat. Finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>this was overcome, and on the 13th they went to their
positions at the place mentioned, where the defenders had
been occupied in constantly repairing the breaches made by
the guns. Trevisano’s galleys were left in the imperial
harbour of Neorion near the end of the chain. His place
was taken by Diedo, captain of the Tana galleys, who was
now appointed to the chief command of the fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A new assault on May 12.</div>

<p>At midnight of the 12th fifty thousand Turks made an
attack near Tekfour Serai, the Palace of the Porphyrogenitus,
between Adrianople Gate and Caligaria, where a
battery of guns had been planted from the commencement
of the siege and had greatly damaged the breastwork and
the Outer Wall. The attack was made with such force, and
the shouting of the invaders was so loud, that Barbaro says
‘most of us believed that they would capture the city.’
Once more the attack failed. On the 14th, Mahomet removed
the guns which he had placed on the slope of Pera
Hill and had them taken to Aivan Serai and placed so as to
attack the gate of the imperial palace of Blachern. It was
found, however, that the guns in this position did no great
harm, and they were once more removed, taken to the Lycus
valley, and placed near the others to batter the walls near
the Romanus Gate. From this time onward this was the
principal place against which Mahomet concentrated his
attack.</p>

<p>The entries in the diaries of the siege, showing that,
while other parts of the wall were often attacked, the bombardment
in the Lycus valley was unceasing day and night,
occur during many days with monotonous regularity.
Equally constant were the efforts for the defence: ‘We, on
our side, were working day and night to repair the walls
with logs and earth and other materials.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">New attempts
to
force the
boom, on
May 16
and 17.</div>

<p>On the 16th, Mahomet, probably because he had learnt
of the landing of Trevisano’s men from the fleet, ordered his
ships at the Double Columns to make another attack upon
the boom. One would have expected that the seventy or
eighty ships that were in the Inner Horn would have
co-operated in this attack but they did not move. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Turk nor Genoese cared to risk open war with the other.
The Turkish fleet came down the Bosporus, and the Greek
and Venetian ships prepared to receive them. As the
Turkish ships came up to the attack, Diedo brought his
vessels from the shelter of the walls of Galata to the
boom. Thereupon the Turks retired, and using their oars
returned to the Columns. A similar incident occurred on
the 17th, but the Turks, again finding that the ships at the
boom were prepared for a fight, went back.</p>

<p>Mahomet, however unwilling to break with the Genoese,
was not content to have communication between the two
divisions of his fleet interrupted. Accordingly, once more he
renewed his attempt to destroy the boom. Barbaro appears
<span class="sidenote">Renewed attempt on May 21.</span>
to have been on one of the ships defending it. On May 21
at two hours before daylight, the whole fleet moved out
from the Double Columns and with great noise of drums
and trumpets came down the Bosporus. All on board the
Christian vessels were greatly alarmed, but dispositions for
the defence were taken, and, as it was feared that contemporaneously
a general attack upon the city was about to
be made, the alarm bells rang out and every one took his
allotted station either on shore or on the ships. Once more
the Turks decided that it was hopeless to attempt the
destruction of the boom, and therefore returned to their
moorings. It is impossible to say whether the Turks really
believed that they might destroy it or whether the three
attempts just mentioned were merely feints to tire out
the besieged and alarm them by a display of overwhelming
force. It is certain, however, that the Venetian and Greek
sailors were always ready to resist, and that, after this attempt
on May 21, Mahomet’s fleet made no further attempt to
force its way into the harbour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts
to undermine
the
walls.</div>

<p>Already, on May 16, the besieged had discovered that
the Turks were attempting to undermine the walls and thus
enter into the city. Zagan Pasha, the renegade Albanian, in
command of Mahomet’s army in Pera and opposite the walls
from Caligaria to the Horn, had under him a number of miners,
who had been brought from Novo Brodo in Serbia and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
possibly were Saxons brought to that country to work in
the silver mines. These men took in hand the task of
undermining. They commenced their work at a distance
sufficiently far removed not to be observed by the besieged.
Probably the first place attacked was between the Adrianople
Gate and Tekfour Serai. They endeavoured to undermine the
foss and the Outer Wall.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> When this failed a second attempt
was made against the walls of the quarter called Caligaria, and
this, says Barbaro, because in that place there were no
enclosures or, as he calls them, ‘barbicans,’ the wall being
single and unprotected even by a ditch. This description
enables us to identify the place as the wall running at right
angles to the northern end of the foss. An Austrian named
John Grant, who acted under the Grand Duke, took charge
of the counterminers and succeeded in finding and entering
the Turkish mine, where he and his men burnt the props.
The works fell in and suffocated a number of Turkish
workmen. The incident greatly alarmed the citizens, who
feared that on future occasions Grant might not be fortunate
enough to discover the mine before the Turks had entered
by it or had blown up a part of the walls. Fortunately, the
rocky character of the ground prevented the miners from
meeting with any notable success. Phrantzes states that
the only damage done by the Turks in mining was to destroy
part of an old tower, which was soon repaired by the
defenders.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Construction
of a
turret,
May 18.</div>

<p>At daylight on May 18, the citizens were astonished to
see a wooden turret or ‘bastion,’ which had been built during
the night.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> The turret had been constructed with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>same secrecy and celerity that Mahomet invariably adopted
in the execution of his plans. Barbaro declares that all the
Christians in the city could not have made it under a month.
It was a huge structure. It was only in the morning, when
they saw it complete in a place where no preparations had
been observed on the previous evening, that they realised
what had been done. This ancient form of the ‘Taker of
Cities’ was stationed near the Romanus Gate. It consisted
of a strong framework of long beams so high as to overlook
the Outer Wall.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> It had been partly filled with earth,
faced with a threefold covering of camels’ or bullocks’ hides,
and was built on wheels or rollers. Steps led to its upper
platform. These and the road which led to the camp, which
was sufficiently distant to be out of range, were also covered
for protection. Scaling-ladders could be raised and thrown
from the summit of the turret to that of the wall. If the
huge machine was, as Barbaro states, within ten paces of the
wall, it must have been built in the foss itself. It dominated
the outer barbican or enclosure and would have allowed the
enemy under cover of its protection to fill the ditch from
three openings which were in the side presented to the walls
and to undermine them in safety. The latter probably was
the principal object for which it was intended. It would
also have enabled the Turks to prevent the besieged
from repairing the damages to the Outer Wall caused
by the cannon. For this reason we can understand the
statement of Barbaro, that while it gave increased hope
to the Turks, it filled the besieged with alarm. It was
built, according to Tetaldi, opposite the place defended
by Justinian.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> Its dangerous character was soon shown.
The cannon having destroyed one of the towers near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Romanus Gate, the turret was moved and stood overhanging
the ditch. A fierce fight took place between the Turks
inside it and the Greeks and Italians under Justiniani. The
Turks flung earth, wood, and all kinds of material available
into the foss, employing mainly the stone from the ruined
tower, so as to form a level pathway across. The besieged
fought hard from daylight till after sunset to prevent the
Turks from making use of the turret, and the emperor and
Justiniani assisted all the night at the repair of the tower.</p>

<p>It was probably the fact that the ditch had been largely
filled with brushwood which brought about the destruction
of the machine. The besieged managed to place barrels of
powder in the ditch, set fire to the brushwood, and blew up
the whole structure. Several of its occupants perished in
the explosion. At daylight the sultan found that his huge
turret was reduced to ashes, that the foss had been cleared
out, and that the ruined tower had been in great part repaired.
He swore that the thirty-seven thousand prophets could not
have persuaded him that the besieged could have compassed
its destruction in so short a time.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p>A similar turret was erected opposite the Pegè Gate, or,
what is more probable, opposite the Third Military Gate,
and possibly there were others near the Golden Gate and
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
attempts
to undermine.</div>

<p>Undeterred by the discovery and failure of the attempt
to undermine the walls at Caligaria, the Turks made other
trials in the same neighbourhood. But Grant was always
ready, countermined and destroyed the enemies’ work before
they could use it. On three successive days mines were
found in this place, ‘where there were no barbicans,’ but
they also were destroyed, and a number of Turks, who could
not escape in time, either lost their lives or were captured.</p>

<p>On the 24th, a mine was found which had apparently
been more carefully concealed. A wooden turret had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>built near the walls, which was intended to serve the double
purpose of deceiving the besieged into supposing that its
object was to facilitate the actual scaling of the walls, while
at the same time it rested on a bridge of logs beneath which
excavation was being made. It contained the earth and
stones which were taken out. The ruse was, however, suspected,
and the counterminers found and destroyed the mine.</p>

<p>The last mine dug by the Turks was found on May 25.
This, says Barbaro, was the most dangerous of all, because
the miners got under the wall, and if powder had been employed,
it would have brought down a portion, and have
made an opening into the city.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<p>Altogether, says Tetaldi, the Turks had made fourteen
attempts to undermine the walls, but the Christians had
listened, had heard and detected them, and had either smoked
out the Turks, destroyed them with stink pots, let in water on
them, or had fought them hand to hand underground.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> In all
cases they had succeeded in preventing any dangerous explosion.
The attempt to gain an entrance by mining had failed.
In the words of Critobulus, Mahomet was now convinced
that mining was vain and useless labour and expense, and
that it was the cannon which would do everything.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<p class="tb">On the 23rd bad news reached the city. The small
brigantine which had been sent out on May 3 returned.
Once more, flying the Turkish flag, she ran the blockade of
the Dardanelles and the entry of the Bosporus, her crew
disguised as Turkish sailors. The Turks, however, near the
city recognised and tried to catch her, but before they could
bring their vessels to the boom, it was opened, and the brave
little ship was once more safely in the Golden Horn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of
brigantine.
Failure to
find
Venetian
fleet.</div>

<p>Unfortunately, her crew had to report their failure to
find the Venetian fleet. They had, nevertheless, done their
work gallantly. Like the men, forty years later, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>Columbus, the sailors appear to have had a voice in determining
what their ship should do. Having completed their
task and decided that it was useless to search any longer for
Loredano, a proposal was made to return to Constantinople.
To this some of the crew objected. They professed to believe,
perhaps did believe, that the city, if not already captured,
would be taken to a certainty before they could reach it.
They had done their best; why should they run the gauntlet
again and return to the doomed city, since they could do no
good? The greater number, however, were true to their
engagement, and their answer has the best quality of seaman-like
loyalty about it: ‘Whether the city be taken or not;
whether it is to life or to death, our duty is to return,’ and in
consequence the brigantine made sail once more for the
Golden Horn.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Supernatural
omens.</div>

<p>During these days&mdash;that is, somewhere between May 22
and 26&mdash;certain events occurred of which mention is made
by several writers.</p>

<p>Though we may regard the narrative of these events
mainly as evidence of the superstition of the age, they have
to be taken into account, inasmuch as they affected the spirit
both of besiegers and besieged. The narratives are vague
and not altogether reconcilable, but Critobulus, a man writing
with exemplary carefulness long after the siege, probably
gives the most accurate summary of what happened, though
his account, like all others, is tinctured by the superstition of
the time. He states that three or four days before the general
assault, when all available citizens, men and women, were
going in solemn procession through the city carrying with
them a statue of the Virgin, the image fell from the hands of
the bearers. It fell as if it had been lead. It was nearly
impossible to raise it, and the task was only accomplished by
the aid of the fervent prayers of priests and of all present.
The fall itself created fear, and was taken to be an omen of
the fall of the city. But this impression was deepened when,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>as the procession continued on its way, there happened a
violent storm of thunder and lightning, followed by torrential
rain. The priests could not make headway against the
flood. The incident was manifestly supernatural. On the
following day the impression was still further accentuated
by the very unusual occurrence in Constantinople at the end
of May of a thick fog, which lasted till evening. The cloud
of fog gave complete confirmation of the impression that
God had abandoned the city, because, as Critobulus remarks,
the Divinity hides His presence in the clouds when He
descends upon the earth.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<p>But the phenomenon of a light which appeared to settle
over Hagia Sophia alarmed both sides. The sultan himself
appears to have considered it an unfavourable omen, until
the braver or more sceptical of his followers, without denying
the evident fact that it was a heaven-sent omen, turned the
difficulty by declaring that it was unfavourable to the Greeks.
Within the city the besieged were even more alarmed than
the Turks.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say what the phenomenon was. Men in
that age expected omens and signs in the heavens and expressed
their disappointment if none were vouchsafed to
them. Writing, as all the narrators did, after the siege, they
would look back to recall what were the signs of the divine
displeasure, and they did not fail to find them. Around the
story of some atmospheric phenomenon there grew a large
myth, until we find The Moscovite recording that the light
of heaven illuminated all the city; that the inhabitants,
believing it to be the reflection of a fire caused by the Turks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>ran towards Hagia Sophia and found flames bursting out of
its upper windows. These flames englobed the dome and
met in a single blaze which rose towards heaven and there
disappeared. The patriarch and the chief dignitaries of the
Church and members of the senate were so impressed with
the tidings of these wonderful signs that they went next day
in a body to the emperor to advise him to leave with the
empress. The patriarch reminded Constantine of well-known
and ancient predictions regarding the fall of the empire,
and named witnesses of the miracle. This new and terrible
augury meant that the grace and goodness of God had abandoned
the city, and that it was decreed to be delivered to
the enemy. When the emperor learned the terrible news
he fell to the ground in a faint. He was revived with
aromatic water, and when he was pressed to leave the city
gave the answer, ‘If it is the will of God, whither can we
fly before His anger?’ He would die with his people.</p>

<p>The growth of the myth is evident. An imaginary empress<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a>
is brought in and a light is introduced, which, if it had
been visible as described, would have been recorded by every
contemporary writer. The unfortunate part of the story is
that it is difficult to say which parts are mythical and which
are true.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<p>Up to May 24, the city had been besieged for upwards
of six weeks. The failure of the brigantine to find the
Venetian fleet was a terrible disappointment to all within
the walls. If aid were coming from Western Europe, it
must be speedy. The besieged could do nothing but fight
on. During the whole six weeks the guns had been pounding
against the walls day and night with ceaseless monotony,
and Greeks and Italians alike, while worn out by frequent
attacks and alarms, were continually occupied in the repair
of the damaged walls. Men and women, girls, old men and
priests, all, says Barbaro, were engaged in this wearisome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>work. The breaching of the walls was steadily going on at
three places, but the damages were greatest in the Lycus
valley. There, indeed, all the force of the enemy seemed
now to have been concentrated. There, especially, was the
big bombard, throwing its ball of twelve hundred pounds
weight which, when it struck the wall, shook it and sent
a tremor through the whole city, so that even on the ships
in the harbour it could be felt.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissensions
among the
besieged.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is convenient to halt here in the narrative of the siege in
order to call attention to certain dissensions within the city.
These dissensions are made much of by the Latin writers
and are probably exaggerated. They arose in great measure
from a traditional ill-feeling, due to history, to difference of
race and language, diversity of interest, and to the hostility
between the Eastern and Western Churches. It is especially
to the differences on the religious question that the Western
writers call attention. In reference to the dissensions among
the Greeks themselves, it must be remembered that the
majority of them, priests and laity, either openly repudiated
the arrangement made at Florence or conformed under
something very near compulsion. The Greeks, says Leonard,
the Catholic archbishop, celebrate the Union with their voice
but deny it in fact.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> He points out that the emperor, for
whose orthodoxy he has nothing but praise, accepted it with
heart and soul. But he was an exception. The majority
still followed the lead of Gennadius and the Grand Duke
Notaras. If it be true that the Grand Duke declared that
he would prefer to see the head-dress of the Turk rather
than that of the Latin priests, his prejudice furnishes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>evidence of the intensity of his dislike for the Latins, and is
confirmatory of other statements made by Leonard. When
the pope’s name was pronounced in the liturgy, the congregation
shouted their disapprobation. Most of the citizens
had shunned the Great Church since the reconciliation service
of December 12 as if it were a Jewish synagogue.
Many who were present on a feast day when Mass was
celebrated left the church as soon as the consecration commenced.</p>

<p>But in addition to the dissensions between the Greeks
themselves was the hostility of both the Latin and Greek
parties towards the Italians. Underlying the animosity
arising from the difference on religious questions was a
traditional sentiment of hostility. They were rivals in
trade. Genoese and Venetians alike were interlopers, who
were taking the bread out of the mouths of the citizens.
The old bitterness arising from the occupation of the city by
the Latins had never been forgotten. The largest colony,
the Genoese, had taken advantage of the weakness of the
empire they had helped to restore, in order to fortify and
enlarge their city of Galata. The Venetians, who had taken
the leading part in the conquest of 1204, had been allowed
to settle within Constantinople, not because they were liked
but because they were the rivals and the enemies of the
Genoese. The exigencies of the situation which led to
their having to be tolerated rankled among the Greeks as
sorely as did the memory of the Latin occupation in
which the Constantinopolitans felt the bitterness of a
conquered people towards masters who held what to them
was a hostile creed.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the siege, doubts had arisen
among the citizens regarding the loyalty of the Venetians.
Five of their ships which had been paid to remain for the
defence of the city were discharging cargo, and the rumour
spread that such cargo was for the use of the Turks. An
imperial order stopped the discharge, and the Venetians saw
in it a violation of their privileges under the capitulations.
The emperor, however, convinced them that he had no such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
design, and they promised, and faithfully kept their promise,
to defend the city until the end of the war.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></p>

<p>But although ultimately these various differences were
sufficiently overcome to prevent any considerable number of
men withdrawing from the defence of the city, discord always
smouldered and occasionally burst into flame. Leonard mentions
an incident which illustrates the bitterness of feeling
which existed between the leaders respectively of Latins and
Greeks. In the very last days of the siege, when a general
attack was daily expected, Justiniani asked from Notaras the
Grand Duke, who was the noble highest in rank, that such
cannon as the city possessed should be given to him for use
in the Lycus valley. The demand was haughtily refused.
‘You traitor!’ said Justiniani; ‘why should I not cut you
down?’ The quarrel went no further, but Notaras is said
to have been less zealous in his work for the defence of the
city. The Greeks, according to Leonard, resented the insult
and became sullen at the treatment of the Grand Duke,
because they believed that the glory of saving the city would
be gained by the Latins alone.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>On the day preceding the final assault the old jealousy
again showed itself. Barbaro relates that he and the other
Venetians made ‘mantles’&mdash;some kind of wooden contrivance
for giving cover to the soldiers on the wall. They were
made at the Plateia, possibly near the end of the present
Inner Bridge. The Venetian bailey gave orders to the
Greeks to carry them to the landward walls. The Greeks
refused unless they were paid. Ultimately the difficulty of
payment was got over, but when the mantles reached the
wall it was already night; and thus, says Barbaro, on account
of the greediness of the Greeks we had to stand at the defence
without them.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>

<p>The dissensions were further increased by discord between
the Italian colonists themselves. We have already
seen that the emperor had been compelled to intervene to
prevent dangerous recriminations between the Venetians
and the Genoese. The former affected to despise the Genoese,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>while the latter, as the possessors of a walled city on
the opposite side of the Golden Horn and as the more
numerous, considered themselves the superiors of their rivals.
The Venetians, on account of their position within the city,
were compelled in their own interest either to help the
Greeks or to get away. The Genoese claimed to be in an
independent position. Each accused the other of the wish
to desert the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charge of
treachery
against the
Genoese.</div>

<p>The most common charge, and one persisted in by the
Venetians, was that the Genoese were traitors to the city
and to Christianity, and it is difficult to say whether the
charge is well founded or not. Barbaro, himself a Venetian,
seldom loses an opportunity of speaking ill of the Genoese;
but the coarseness and recklessness of his attacks lessen
their value. If the charges of treachery depended on his
evidence alone, they might be dismissed. But other evidence
is at hand. We have seen that the Genoese are alleged to
have claimed that they could have burnt the sultan’s ships
when they made their passage overland and would have done
so if they had not been his friends. Leonard, who was a
Genoese, evidently believed that they were traitors to
Christianity and were playing a double game. ‘They ought
to have prevented the building of the fortress at Roumelia-Hissar.
But,’ he concludes, ‘I will keep silence, lest I should
speak ill of my own people, whom foreigners may justly
condemn.’ They are nevertheless condemned by him because
they ‘did not lend help to the Lord against the mighty.’</p>

<p>The evidence in their favour is, however, not weak.
First and foremost, John Justiniani was a Genoese. His
loyalty and the bravery and labours day and night of the
Genoese soldiers were beyond cavil. Ducas himself states
that the Genoese sent men from Galata who fought
valiantly under Justiniani; that many of them acted as spies,
sold provisions to the Turks, and secretly during the night
brought to the Greeks the news they had gathered. The
Podestà of Galata, writing shortly after the capture of the
city, declares that every available man had been sent across
the Horn to the defence of the walls. He protests that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
had done his best, because he knew that if Constantinople
were lost, the loss of Pera would follow.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></p>

<p>The truth appears to be that the sympathy of the Podestà
and the leading men was with their fellow Christians, but
that the hostility of the Greeks and trade rivalry caused many
of the Genoese too often to regard them as enemies. The
Podestà is probably correctly expressing his own opinion
and that of the better Genoese in stating that he foresaw
that if Mahomet captured Constantinople, Galata would
become an easy prey. But the certainty of making a good
profit by dealing with the enemy was too great a temptation
to be resisted by the ordinary merchant. Under cover of
night he passed safely across the harbour and sold his goods
to the citizens. He was equally ready during the day to
deal with the Turks. The statement of Pusculus that the
Genoese informed Mahomet by signal of the departure of
the ships upon their night attack to burn the Turkish vessels
which had been transported overland may be accepted as
true, but the signal was probably the act of a private
individual, for which the colony ought not to be held
responsible. The boast reported by Ducas as having been
made by the notables to Mahomet that they could have
prevented the transport of the ships showed at least that
they endeavoured to persuade him that they were neutral.
It is by no means certain that had the Genoese desired to
destroy the ships during the transit they could have made
the attempt with a reasonable hope of success. They
were far too few to meet the Turks outside the walls.
However this may have been, they remained faithful to the
conditions of the treaty which had existed before the time
of Mahomet and which had been confirmed while he was
at Adrianople on the express condition that they should not
give aid to Constantinople. Even the complaint of Leonard
that they could have saved the city if they had endeavoured
to prevent Mahomet from securing a base of operations by
building the fortifications at Hissar is a complaint against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>the policy of neutrality. It would no doubt have been not only
more in accordance with the crusading spirit but possibly
wiser and better in the interest of Europe and of civilisation
if the Genoese, as Leonard suggests that they ought to have
done, had violated their treaty and had made common cause
openly with the emperor from the first; but to have done so
would have been to risk the capture of Galata. Their policy
was not a lofty one. Looked at by the light of subsequent
events, it was not merely selfish but fatal; but it was no
more treacherous than the policy of neutrals generally is.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the various dissensions between
the citizens and the foreigners and between the latter themselves
tended to make some of the Greeks lukewarm in their
defence of the city. They were not going to fight for
papists and heretics, or even for an emperor who had gone
over to the papists. Leonard asserts that there were many
defections; that during the siege men who ought to have
been at the walls tried to desert the city, pretended that
they could not fight, that they wanted to attend to their
fields and vineyards; that others with whom he spoke urged
that they must earn their bread, and that, in answer to his
urging them to fight not only because of their duty to aid all
Christians but because their own fate was at stake, they
replied, ‘What does the capture of the city matter to us if
our families die of starvation?’<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> His statement that many
men left the city is not sufficiently supported by other
evidence to cause it to be accepted without hesitation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Witnesses
against
Greeks are
nearly all
Latins.</div>

<p>In reading the charges brought against the Greek citizens
by Leonard, it must be noted that he himself was a Genoese
and a Latin archbishop. Unfortunately, almost all our accounts
of the siege come either from Western writers or from
Greek converts who are imbued with the usual bitterness
against the professors of the faith which they have abandoned.
Barbaro and Pusculus were Latins. Phrantzes and Ducas
belonged to the Catholic party. The reports of the Podestà
of Galata, of Cardinal Isidore, and other documents emanating
from Latin sources all help to give a version unfavourable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>the Greeks. Indeed Critobulus almost stands alone as the
representative of the larger party in the Orthodox Church.
When, however, we get the account of an independent
Western soldier, as in the case of Tetaldi, the charges against
the Greek population disappear. In the whole of his clear
and concise narrative, as well as in his estimate of how Europe
might defeat the Turks, he has not a word to say against
the conduct of the besieged. While praising the courage
of the Turks highly as that of men who in the perils and
hazards of war attach hardly any value to their lives, he yet
judges that the Greeks with European help could defeat them.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>
These and other facts are at least sufficient to cause us to regard
with suspicion attacks upon the loyalty towards the
city and the emperor of the members of the Orthodox Church.
Gibbon, influenced by the writers of the Latin Church&mdash;the
only ones available to him&mdash;remarks ‘that the Greeks
were animated only by the spirit of religion, and that
spirit was productive only of animosity and discord.’ The
observation or charge would hardly have been made if he
had remembered the <i>ex parte</i> character of all the evidence
before him. While there is truth in the statement that the
spirit of religion produced animosity and discord, it is far
from true either that it was the only spirit which actuated the
Greeks or that it was productive only of animosity and discord.
The Greeks were actuated by their own worldly
interest, by their desire to preserve their own lives and
property, their own city and their own government. Nor
in admitting that they were even deeply animated with the
religious spirit, can it successfully be maintained that this
spirit only produced animosity. It was the religious spirit
which animated Greeks as well as Italians to fight for the
honour of God and the benefit of Christianity and thus
tended to suppress discord and animosity. Even theological
differences did not make the Greeks less eager to prevent a
Moslem from taking the place of a Christian emperor. The
Greeks differed from and even quarrelled with the Italians
and their Romanised fellow citizens, but they regarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Genoese and Italians not merely as fighting for the interests
of Venice and Genoa, but as helping them to keep their
own, and the evidence is certainly insufficient to show that
such animosity and discord as existed prevented Greeks and
Italians alike from doing their utmost to keep the common
enemy of Christendom out of the city.</p>

<p>My reading of the contemporary narratives leads me to
conclude that, in spite of the isolated examples of dissensions
mentioned by Leonard, of deep differences of opinion on the
great religious question, and of constant jealousies between
Greeks and Italians and between Venetians and Genoese,
the unity of sentiment among the besieged for the defence
of the city was well maintained. They might quarrel on
minor questions, but on the duty and the desirability of
keeping Mahomet out they were united. I doubt the
statement as to many defections and, remembering how
many and grave the reasons for dissensions were, consider
that if they could be shown to have taken place in any
considerable numbers it would not be a matter for wonder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations
for
a general
assault.</div>

<p class="tb">We have seen that during the seven weeks in which
Mahomet’s army had been encamped before the triple walls
of the Queen City he had attempted to capture it by attacks
directed almost exclusively against the landward walls.
He was now preparing to make one directed upon all parts
of the city together. Hitherto, notwithstanding his balistas,
mangonels, and spingards, his turrets, his cannon and his
mining operations, he had failed. But his preparations had
all rendered the general assault which he contemplated more
formidable in character and easier of accomplishment. He
had collected together all the various appliances known to
mediaeval engineers for attacking a walled city; two
thousand scaling-ladders were ready for the assault, hooks
for pulling down stones, destroying the walls, and forcing
an entry. But the amassing of all his paraphernalia, and
even all his mining operations, sink into insignificance as
preparations for a general attack when compared with
the work done by his great cannon. Primitive as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
were in construction when measured with the guns of
our own days, the Turks had employed them effectively.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Breaches
made by
Turks in
three
places.</div>

<p>They had concentrated their fire mainly in three places.
Five cannon had discharged their balls against the walls
between the Palace of Porphyrogenitus and the Adrianople
Gate; four, among which was the largest, against those in the
Lycus valley near the Romanus Gate, and three against the
walls near the Third Military Gate.</p>

<p>The evidence presented to-day by the ruined condition
of the walls in these places corroborates the statements
made by contemporaries, that these were the principal places
bombarded. Mahomet was already able to claim with some
justice that he had opened three entrances for his army into
the city.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> Several of the towers between the Adrianople
Gate and Caligaria had been destroyed. The Anatolian
division had greatly weakened those in the neighbourhood
of the Third Military Gate. But the most extensive
destruction had been wrought by the Janissaries with the
aid of the great cannon of Urban. While in each of the
three places mentioned the Outer Wall is even now in an
exceptionally dilapidated condition, the ruins in the valley
of the Lycus show that this was the place where the cannon
<span class="sidenote">Lycus valley chief point of attack.</span>
had been steadily pounding day and night. Along almost
the whole length of the foss, extending for upwards of three
miles, its side walls and a great portion of the breastwork
still remain, mostly, to all appearances, as solid as when they
were new. But in the lower part of the Lycus valley
hardly more than a trace of either is to be distinguished.
The breastwork had been entirely destroyed and had helped
to raise the foss to the level of the adjoining ground. A
large portion of the Outer Wall and some of its towers had
been broken down. The ruins of the Bactatinean tower had
helped to fill the ditch; two towers of the great Inner Wall
had fallen. A breach of twelve hundred feet long according
to Tetaldi had been made opposite the place where Mahomet
had his tent.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> Here, where the largest cannon was placed,
the struggles had been keenest. Here was the station of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
John Justiniani with his two thousand men, among whom
were his own four hundred Genoese cuirassiers with their
arms glittering in the sun to the delight, says Leonard, of
their Greek fellow fighters. While the cannon had greatly
damaged the walls in the other two places mentioned, here,
says Critobulus, they had entirely destroyed them. There was
a wall no longer, nor did there in this part exist any longer
a ditch, for it had been filled up by the Turkish troops.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></p>

<p>Hence it was that in this part Justiniani and those under
him had been constantly occupied in repairs. Day after
day the diarists recount that the principal occupation of the
besieged was to repair during the night the part of the walls
destroyed during the day by the cannon. Without experience
of the power of great guns even in their then early
stage of development, the besieged tried to lessen the force
of the balls by suspending from the summit of the walls a
sheathing of bales of wool. This and other expedients had
failed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Construction
of
stockade.</div>

<p>As the best substitute for the broken-down Outer Wall
Justiniani had gradually, as it was destroyed, constructed
a Stockade, called by the Latin writers a Vallum and by the
Greeks a <i>Stauroma</i>. On the ruined wall a new one was thus
built almost as rapidly as the old one was destroyed. It was
made with such materials as were at hand, of stones from
the broken wall, of baulks of timber, of trees and branches,
and even of crates filled with straw and vine cuttings, of
ladders and fascines, all cemented hastily together with
earth and clay. The whole was faced with hides and skins
so as to prevent the materials being burnt by ‘fire-bearing
arrows.’ In employing earth and clay the defenders intended
that the stone cannon-balls should bury themselves in the
yielding mass and thus do less damage than when striking
against stone. Within the stockade was a second ditch
from which probably the clay had been removed to cement
the materials of the stockade, while above it were placed
barrels or vats filled with earth so as to form a crenellation
and a defence to the fighters against the missiles of the Turks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>
<p>The stockade was probably about four hundred yards
long and occupied only the lower part of the valley, shutting
in the portion of the Inner Enclosure and being thus a
substitute for the Outer Wall. The usual entrance to this
enclosure or Peribolos was by the Military Gate of St.
Romanus&mdash;formerly known as the Pempton&mdash;which, indeed,
had been constructed solely for this purpose, and by two
small gates or posterns at its respective ends, one at the
Adrianople Gate, the other at Top Capou. Another postern
had, however, says Critobulus, been opened by Justiniani
to give easier access to the stockade from the city.</p>

<p>The construction of the stockade had been commenced
immediately after the destruction of the tower near the
Romanus Gate, on April 21.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> As the attention of the enemy
had been principally directed to the attack on the walls in this
part of the city, so the stockade which replaced the Outer
Wall continued to the end to be the focus on which was
concentrated nearly the entire strength of his attack. No
one could say what would be Mahomet’s plan of battle, but
no one doubted that the stockade covering the St. Romanus
Gate&mdash;or, as it is called in old Turkish maps, the ‘Gate of
the Assault’&mdash;would at least be one of the chief places against
which he would direct an assault. Behind it and between
it and the great Inner Wall was the flower of the defending
army. The emperor himself had his camp quite near,
though within the city, while Justiniani, standing for all
time as the most conspicuous figure on the Christian side,
was in command within the stockade. His energy and his
courage had called forth the unqualified admiration of friend
and foe. The jealousy of the Venetians at his appointment
had long since been overcome. While Barbaro launches his
recriminations against the Genoese generally, and even
sometimes against Justiniani himself, even he is constrained
to repeat that the presence of the great Genoese captain was
<i>per benefitio de la Christianitade et per honor de lo mundo</i>.
His example communicated itself to his troops, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>thus became the hero of all who were fighting. All the city,
says the Florentine soldier Tetaldi, had great hopes in him
and in his valour. Mahomet himself was reported to have
expressed admiration of the courage and ability, the fertility
of resource and the activity of Justiniani, and to have regretted
that he was not in the Turkish army. In front of
the stockade was the sultan, surrounded by his white-capped
Janissaries and the red-fezzed other members of his chosen
bodyguard. Everything indeed pointed to a great fight at
the stockade, where the great leaders and the flower of
each army stood opposite each other.</p>

<p class="tb">About the beginning of the last week in May the Turks
were alarmed by the rumour of an approaching fleet and of
an army of Hungarians under John Hunyadi, both of which
were reported to be on their way to the relief of the city.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a>
The alarm, however, proved to be false. As Phrantzes
laments, no Christian prince sent a man or a penny to the
aid of the city.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> At first sight it is somewhat surprising
that no aid came either from the Serbians or Hungarians.
During the early days of the siege assistance had been
hoped for from both of these peoples. Phrantzes states
that the despot of Serbia, George Brancovich, treated the
sultan in such a manner as to make Mahomet taunt the
Christians with his hostility to Constantine.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> With the
recollection of the Turkish victories at Varna and at
Cossovo-pol, and especially of the fact that he had himself
been attacked because he would not join in violating the
peace between Ladislaus and Murad, it is probable enough
that Brancovich was not unfriendly towards Mahomet.
Indeed, at the request of the young sultan, he had used his
influence to bring about a three years’ armistice between the
Turks and the Hungarians. It is not, therefore, surprising
that no aid came from him.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>More success might have been anticipated from negotiations
with Hungary. Here, however, the three years’
agreement (made eighteen months before the siege) for an
armistice stood in the way. The Hungarians had received
a terrible lesson&mdash;at Varna&mdash;on the breaking of treaties, and
they hesitated before violating the new arrangement. Ducas
and Phrantzes agree in stating that the agents of Hunyadi
had come to the city in the early days of the siege and had
requested the sultan, on behalf of their principal, to give back
the copy of the armistice signed by him in return for that
signed by Mahomet. They gave as a pretext that Hunyadi
was no longer viceroy of the king of Hungary. The design
was too transparent to be accepted by the Turks.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> The
idea was to suggest to the sultan that the Hungarians
were coming to the aid of the city; that they had compunctions
about breaking the treaty, but that, as it was not signed
by the prince, they had a valid excuse for so doing. To
this extent what was done indicated a spirit friendly to the
besieged. The sultan and his council promised to consider
the proposition, and put the agents of Hunyadi off with a
civil and banal reply.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></p>

<p>Ducas tells a story regarding the visits of the agents of
Hunyadi which may be noticed, though he is careful to
give it as hearsay. He says that the officers in their suite
showed the gunners how they might use their great bombard
more effectually to destroy the walls by directing their fire
in succession against two points instead of one, so as to form
a triangle, and that the device succeeded to such an extent
that the tower near the Romanus Gate and a part of the
wall on each side of it was so broken down that the besiegers
and besieged could see each other.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Last days.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> May 25 it was well understood both by besiegers and
besieged that the crisis of the struggle had come and that a
general attack by land and sea and by all the forces which
the sultan possessed was at hand and would result in a contest
which would probably decide the fate of the city.
Mahomet was able to choose his own time and make
characteristic preparations. The differences in the final
preparations of besiegers and besieged arose from two
causes: first, from the disparity in numbers between the
huge host of the besiegers and the small army defending
the city; second, from the fact that the Turkish army consisted
exclusively of men, while the population of the city
was largely composed of women and children, of priests,
monks, and nuns. On one side was a large host without
non-combatants; on the other a small but valiant army
worn out by wearisome work, unrelieved, and encumbered
with a great number of useless non-combatants. While the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
descriptions of what was done during the last days by the
besiegers give us mainly military preparations with a day
devoted to fasting and rest, those of the besieged are
crowded with accounts of religious processions, of sensuous
ceremonies, of penitents, of churches filled with people
endeavouring to appease the wrath of an offended God and
beseeching the aid of the Virgin and saints. But notwithstanding
this colouring of the conduct of the defenders&mdash;and it
must always be remembered that the descriptions are written
by Churchmen&mdash;the soldiers were not unmindful of their
duty. Constantine and the leaders neglected no precautions
for defence, carefully noted that their orders were obeyed,
and were now engaged in making a final disposition of their
small force. All had their allotted task: even the women
and children were called upon day and night to aid in
repairing the damage done by the guns; natives and
foreigners vied with each other in zeal for the defence.</p>

<p>Whether the leaders realised that their struggles were
hopeless may be doubted, though it is difficult to believe
that they could feel confidence in the result. It is certain
that they all recognised that the final struggle would be for
life or death. The population generally were buoyed up
with the knowledge of the failure of the Turks to capture
the city in 1422, within the recollection of many of the
citizens, and possibly&mdash;though not, I think, to any great
extent&mdash;by the hope of miraculous intervention on their
behalf. The faith which accepted the legend of an advance
being permitted as far as St. Sophia and of an angel who would
then descend and hand over the government of the city to
the emperor may have existed among the women and monks,
but it is not of the kind which soldiers, and still less even
religious military commanders, possess. The leaders, from
the emperor downwards, knew the weakness of the city, the
insufficiency of men to defend fourteen miles of walls, and
the overwhelming superiority in numbers of the Turkish
army. The bad news brought on the 23rd by the brigantine
sent to search for the Venetian fleet had almost dispelled
hope of timely aid from the West, though many still clung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
to the belief that they might welcome a few more Italians
who were reported to have been seen at Chios on their way
to the capital.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<p>On Thursday, May 24, Barbaro notes that there were
music and feasting and other signs of rejoicing among the
Turks because they had learned that they were about to
make a general attack.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></p>

<p>On the 25th and the 26th the great guns were constantly
at work in the Lycus valley and at the two other
places already described. On the evening, however, of the
26th, at one hour after sunset, the Turks made a great
illumination along the whole length of their line. Every
tent in the enemy’s camp could be seen. The fires were so
great as to show everything as clearly as if it were day.
They lasted till midnight. The shouts from the Turks rent
the heavens. The archbishop states that a Turkish edict or
<i>Iradè</i> had given notice that for three days praise should be
offered to God, but that on one day there should be fasting.
The illuminations in which the Turks indulged and the
nightly feasting are what take place usually during the
month of Ramazan. But as this was not Ramazan, every
one rightly conjectured that they indicated that the Turks
had received the welcome news of a general and immediate
attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sultan
hesitates
to attack.</div>

<p>Even, however, in these last days of the siege the sultan
appears to have seriously hesitated whether to make the
attack or abandon the attempt to capture the city. Many
of the Turks really appear to have lost heart. They had
been seven weeks before the city and had accomplished
nothing. The pashas themselves were divided in opinion.
Various rumours were current in the camp which increased
their hesitation. Western Europe would not allow Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>stantinople
to be captured. The princes of the West were
leagued together to drive the Turks out of Europe. John
Hunyadi, with a large force of infantry and cavalry, was on
his way to relieve the city.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> A great fleet prepared at the
request and with the aid of the pope, the head of Christendom,
was on its way out, and its van had already been
heard of at Chios.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> There were not wanting many in
Mahomet’s camp who were opposed to a continuation of
the siege and who urged him to abandon it. The sultan,
according to Phrantzes, was influenced and depressed by the
rumours of the interference of Western Europe, especially
by the news of the arrival of a fleet at Chios,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> by the want
of success which had so far attended his efforts to enter the
city, by the stubbornness of the defence and the strength of
the walls, and, lastly, by omens deduced from flashes of
lightning which had played over the city, or from some
atmospheric effect which had lighted up the dome of St.
Sophia&mdash;omens which, at first interpreted as a sign of God’s
vengeance on the Constantinopolitans, were a little later construed
by some of the Turks to be a token that it was taken
under Divine protection.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Sends
Ismail to
inquire as
to possibility
of
surrender.</div>

<p>It was probably in consequence of this depression that
even at this late stage Mahomet made one more effort to
induce the Greeks to surrender the city. A certain Ismail,
the son of Alexander who had obtained the rule over Sinope
by accepting the suzerainty of the Turks, came into the city
at the request of the sultan and endeavoured to persuade
the Greeks to make terms. He spoke of his own influence
with Mahomet and promised, if they would appoint a
messenger, to use it to procure for him a favourable hearing.
He declared that unless terms were made the city
would certainly be captured, the men killed, and their wives
and daughters sold as slaves.</p>

<p>Upon Ismail’s suggestion a messenger, but a man of no
particular name or family, went with Ismail to Mahomet.
According to Chalcondylas, the answer sent to the Greeks
was that they should pay an annual tribute of ten myriads
or one hundred thousand gold bezants, and if this condition
were not accepted Mahomet would permit as an alternative
that all the inhabitants should leave the city, taking with
them their own property, with leave to go whither they
wished. He would be content to receive the deserted city.
The Greeks, though with some difference of opinion, decided
that they could not and would not accept either of the conditions
offered. Possibly not a few of them were of the
opinion of Chalcondylas, that the offer was not serious on
the sultan’s part&mdash;that is, that he did not believe that there
was any chance of its being accepted&mdash;but that it was rather
an attempt to learn what the feeling was among the Greeks
in regard to their chance of success. Mahomet had nothing
to lose by his offer. He knew that the inhabitants could
not pay the amount of tribute demanded. If, on the other
hand, they had been willing to desert the city in order to
save their lives, he would have gained an easy victory
without bloodshed&mdash;a victory which he was by no means
certain he could gain after a general assault. If the story of
Chalcondylas is to be believed, then additional doubt is
thrown on the statement of Ducas that the emperor on a
previous occasion had voluntarily offered to pay any tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
which might be demanded. I am disposed to give credence
to Chalcondylas.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> Ismail was a very likely man to be employed
by Mahomet. The sultan rightly judged that the
besieged would be willing to accept conditions, and would
desire to learn what his conditions were. The answer convinced
him, however, that his only chance of gaining the
city was by fighting for it.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<p>On Friday, May 25, and Saturday the Turks continued
their cannonading against ‘our poor walls’ even harder than
ever. Greeks and Italians busied themselves in repairing
the damages as fast as they were made, and this in such
good fashion, says Barbaro, that even after all that the great
guns could do ‘we made them as strong as they were at
first.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sultan
calls
council to
consider
desirability
of raising
siege.</div>

<p>Meantime it was necessary for the sultan to put an end
to all hesitation as to the commencement of the general
attack. A council was held for this purpose on Saturday the
26th or Sunday the 27th, in which the arguments in favour of
and against the siege were fully discussed. Halil Pasha, the
grand vizier and the man of greatest reputation, declared
himself in favour of abandoning it. He reminded his master
that he had always been opposed to it and had foretold
failure from the outset. The strong position of the city
made it invincible, now that the Latins were aiding the
citizens. He urged that sooner or later Christian kings and
people would be provoked by its capture and would intervene.
The Genoese and Venetians, against their wish, would become
enemies of the Turks if the war went on. He therefore
advised retreat while this could be done in safety.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> Halil
Pasha’s rival and enemy was the Albanian Zagan Pasha,
who was next him in rank. While Halil was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>favourable to the Christians,<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> Zagan was their enemy.
Zagan, seeing the Sultan downcast at having to raise the
siege, boldily advocated an attack. He urged that the
appearance of the light over Hagia Sophia, which had been
taken by some of the Turks to indicate that the city was
under divine protection, really meant that it would be
delivered into the sultan’s hands. He reminded his young
master that Alexander the Great had conquered the world
with a much smaller army than was now before the city.
As to the coming of fleets from the West, he neither believed
nor feared it. The division among its princes would bring
anarchy into any fleet they might get together. There was
and could be no concert among them. Besides, even if such
a fleet arrived, there were three or four times as many Turks
as any fleet could bring. He recommended, therefore, that
the attack should be pushed on vigorously: that the cannons
should be kept constantly going, so as to make new breaches
or widen those already made in the walls, and that all thought
of retreat should be abandoned. The younger members of
the council agreed with him, as did also the leader of the
Thracian troops&mdash;that is, the Bashi-bazouks&mdash;and strongly
urged an attack. This advice stiffened the sultan’s own
determination. Mahomet ordered Zagan Pasha to go
himself that very night among the troops and learn what
was their mind on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> Zagan obeyed the order,
returned, and reported that he had visited the army, which
desired orders for an immediate attack. He assured the
sultan that he could fight with confidence and be certain of
victory.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Decides
upon
attack.</div>

<p>Upon this report the sultan announced his intention to
make a general assault forthwith, and from this time devoted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>himself solely to completing his final preparations.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> He
ordered that during the following nights fires should be
lighted and torches burned, that the soldiers should fast
during the following day, should go through their ceremonial
ablutions seven times and ask God’s aid in capturing the
city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Makes
final
arrangements
for
general
attack.</div>

<p>The sultan rose early on the morning of Sunday the
27th. He called those in charge of the guns and ordered
them to concentrate the fire of their cannon against the
walls of the stockade. He disposed his bodyguard, according
to the arms they carried, into regiments&mdash;some of which
contained upwards of a thousand men&mdash;and directed that
when the order was given they should be sent forward in
succession; that after one division had fought it should
retire and rest while another took its place. In so doing he
intended that the general attack should continue until it
ended in victory without giving the besieged any time for
rest. It was perhaps the best way to take advantage of
his enormous superiority in numbers.</p>

<p>Then he visited the other troops from sea to sea, repeating
his orders to the leaders, encouraging all by his presence,
and seeing that all arrangements had been made as he had
directed.</p>

<p>Mahomet sent a message to Galata insisting that the
Genoese should prevent help being sent clandestinely to the
city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proclaims
three days
of plunder.</div>

<p>He caused his heralds to proclaim through the camp
that his soldiers would be allowed to sack the city during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>three days: to announce that the sultan swore by the everlasting
God, by the four thousand prophets, by Mahomet,
by the soul of his father, and by his children, that the whole
population, men, women, and children, all the treasure and
whatever was found in the city should be given up freely by
him to his warriors. The proclamation was received with
tumultuous expressions of triumph.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> ‘If you had heard the
shouts raised to heaven with the cry, ‘There is one God, and
Mahomet is his prophet,’ you would indeed have marvelled,’
adds Leonard.</p>

<p>No attempt was made on the Saturday, Sunday, or
Monday to capture the city, but the guns were steadily
pounding away during all these three days.</p>

<p>On Sunday the great cannon fired three times at the
stockade, and at the third shot a portion of it came down.
According to the Muscovite, Justiniani was wounded by a
splinter from the ball and had to be led or carried into the city.
He, however, recovered during the night and superintended
once more the repairs of the walls.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></p>

<p>On the Sunday also every Turk was busy in completing
preparations for the final attack.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> Every man had been
ordered under pain of death to be at his post.</p>

<p>The Turks were observed to be fetching earth, crates of
vine-cuttings and other materials to level a passage across
the foss, making scaling-ladders, and generally to be bringing
forward all the engines for assault. When the sun set,
fires and torches were lighted as on the previous night.
The illuminations were accompanied by such terrible shouts
that Barbaro, with not unnatural exaggeration, asserts that
they were heard across the Bosporus. The soldiers, in high
spirits at the thought of the coming attack, were once more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>feasting, after their day’s fast. The besieged, hearing the
shouts, the sound of the trumpets and guitars, of pipes, fifes,
and drums, and the usual din, ran to the walls, for the illumination
was so great that they were in hopes that the fires were
devouring tents and provisions; but, says Ducas, when they
recognised that there was no alarm among their enemies,
they could only pray to be delivered from the imminent
danger. The illuminations continued until midnight, and
then, more suddenly than they had appeared, the fires were
extinguished and the camp was left in complete obscurity.</p>

<p>The leaders on both sides had now but few final arrangements
to make for attack or for defence. The sultan, as usual,
personally superintended the making of those on the Turkish
side.</p>

<p>On Monday morning Mahomet accompanied by a large
following of horsemen, which Barbaro estimates at about
ten thousand, rode over to the Double Columns and
arranged for the co-operation of the fleet while the general
bombardment and attack were being made by the rest of
his forces.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> Admiral Hamoud, the successor of Baltoglu,
was to spread out his ships on the Marmora side from
St. Eugenius Gate to that of Psamatia, to prepare to enter
the city by scaling-ladders from the ships, if entrance
were possible, and at all events by his preparations and
feigned attacks to draw off as many men as possible from
the defence of the landward walls.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>Mahomet returned in the afternoon from the Double
Columns. On the same day, and possibly on his return, the
sultan summoned to him the heads of the Genoese community
in Galata and confirmed the strict injunction he had already
given them that on no account were they to render aid to
the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>After crossing the Golden Horn he once more rode along
the whole line of the walls from the Horn to the Marmora,
to inspect his troops and see that all was ready. He passed
before his three great divisions: Europeans, under Caraja; the
select troops, including the Janissaries, before the Myriandrion
and the Mesoteichion, and the Asiatic division, between Top
Capou and the sea, each of about fifty thousand men, and saw
<span class="sidenote">Mahomet addresses the pashas,</span>
that all was ready. After having thus inspected his fleet
and his army, he summoned the pashas and chief military
and naval officers once more to his tent. Critobulus gives
us an account of what was said which probably represents
fairly what passed. The decision was taken. The city was
to be attacked. Before the assault began it was necessary
for Mahomet to explain his plan of assault, give his final
orders, and hold out to his followers every possible inducement
to fight bravely.</p>

<p>The sultan began by recalling to his hearers that in the
city there was an infinite amount and variety of wealth of
all kinds&mdash;treasure in the palaces and private houses, churches
abounding in furniture of silver, gold, and precious stones.
All were to be theirs. There were men of high rank and in
great numbers who could be captured and sold as slaves;
there were great numbers of ladies of noble families, young
and beautiful, and a host of other women, who could either
be sold or taken into their harems. There were boys of
good family. There were houses and beautiful gardens.
‘I give you to-day,’ said Mahomet, ‘a grand and populous
city, the capital of the ancient Romans, the very summit of
splendour and of glory, which has become, so to say, the
centre of the world. I give it over for you to pillage, to
seize its incalculable treasures of men, women, and boys, and
everything that adorns it. You will henceforward live
in great happiness and leave great wealth to your children.’
The chief gain for all the sons of Othman would be the
conquest of a city whose fame was great throughout the
whole world. The greater its renown, the greater would be
the glory of taking it by assault. A great city which had
always been their enemy, which had always looked upon
them with a hostile eye, which in every way had sought to
destroy the Turkish power, would come into their possession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
The door would be open to them by its capture to conquer
the whole of the Greek empire.</p>

<p>To this promise recorded by Critobulus may be added
what is said by the Turkish historian, that Mahomet urged
that the capture would be an augmentation of the glory of
their faith, and that it was clearly predicted in the ‘Sacred
Traditions.’<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p>The sultan further urged them not to believe that capture
was impossible. You see, he remarked, that the foss is filled
and that the walls have been so destroyed by the guns in
three places that they may be crossed not only by infantry,
but even by cavalry. They form no longer an impregnable
barrier, for the way has been made almost as level as a race
course.</p>

<p>He declared that he knew the defenders to be so weak
that he believed the reports of deserters who stated that
there were only two or three men to garrison each tower, so
that a single man would have to defend three or four crenellations;
and the men themselves were ill-armed and unskilled
in warfare. They had been harassed day and night and
were worn out, were short of provisions, and could not maintain
resistance against a continuous attack. He had decided
to employ the great number of his followers in making a
continuous assault, day and night, sending up fresh detachments
one after the other, until the enemy from sheer
weariness would be forced to yield or be incapable of further
resistance.</p>

<p>Mahomet pretended once more to be uncertain what the
conduct of the Italians would be during the coming assault.
The cause was not theirs. They would not sacrifice their lives
where there was nothing to gain. The mixed crowd, gathered
from many places, had no intention of dying for the city, and
when they saw the waves of his men succeeding each other at
the attack they would throw down their arms and turn their
backs. Even if, from any cause, they did not run away, they
were too few to resist his army. The city, both by land and
sea, was surrounded as in a net and could not escape.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>
<p>Mahomet concluded by urging all to fight valiantly,
assuring his hearers that he would be at their head and
would see all that passed. He finished his address by charging
his hearers to return to their posts, to order all under their
commands to take food, and then to lie down for a few hours’
rest. Silence was everywhere to be observed. They were
enjoined to draw up their men in battle array at an early
hour in the morning, and when they heard the sound of the
trumpet summoning them to battle and saw the standard
unfurled, then ‘to the work in hand.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">and the
leaders of
divisions.</div>

<p>The leaders of divisions remained, after the departure of
the larger assembly, in order to receive their final orders.
Hamoud, with his fleet, was to keep near the seaward
walls and the archers and fusiliers<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> should be so ready to
shoot, that no man dare show his head at the battlements.
Zagan was to cross the bridge, and with the ships in the
harbour to attack the walls on the Golden Horn. Caraja
was to cross the foss&mdash;probably between Tekfour Serai and
the Adrianople Gate, where was one of the three roads that
Mahomet had opened into the city&mdash;and to try to capture the
wall. Isaac and Mahmoud, at the head of the Asiatic division,
were charged to attempt the walls near the Third Military
Gate. Halil and Saraja, who were in command of the troops
encamped around the sultan, opposite the third and most important
breach&mdash;that, namely, at the Romanus Gate, defended
by Justiniani&mdash;were to follow the lead which the sultan would
himself give them.</p>

<p>Having thus made his final dispositions, Mahomet dismissed
his inner council, and each leader went away to his
own tent to sleep and await the signal for attack.</p>

<p>The speech to his leaders, which I have summarised in
the preceding paragraphs from the report given by Critobulus,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a>
is also recorded by Phrantzes, though at much less
length. He describes it as having been made at sunset of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>the 28th,<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> and makes the sultan remind his leaders, with the
usual voluptuous details, of the glories of paradise promised
to the true believer who dies in battle.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations
within the
city.</div>

<p class="tb">Meanwhile, within the city preparation of a different
kind had been made. After the meeting of the council of
Turkish nobles, the besieged, who seem always to have been
well informed of what went on in the enemy’s camp, learned
at once that it had been decided to make a general assault
forthwith. All day long during the last day of agony the
alarm bell was ringing to call men, women, and children to
their posts. Each man had his duty allotted to him for the
morrow, while even women and children were employed to
carry up stones to the walls to be hurled down upon the
Turks.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> The bailey of the Venetian colony issued a final
appeal, calling upon all his people to aid in the defence,
and urging them to fight and be ready to die for the love
of God, the defence of the country, and ‘per honor de tuta
la Christianitade.’ All honest men, says the Venetian
diarist, obeyed the bailey’s command, and the Venetians,
besides aiding in the defence of the walls, took charge of the
ships in the harbour and were guardians of the boom.
Barbaro and his fellow citizens occupied the day in making
mantles for the protection of the soldiers upon the walls.</p>

<p>The silence during the Monday before the landward
walls was more impressive than the noise of previous warlike
preparations. The Turks were keeping their fast.
Probably during the afternoon they were allowed to sleep in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>order that they might be fresh for the attack on the following
morning, for, says Critobulus, the Romans were surprised
at the quietness in the camp. Various conclusions were
drawn from the silence. Some thought that the enemy was
getting ready to go away; others that preparations were being
completed which were less noisy than usual.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></p>

<p>The reader of the original narratives gets weary of the
constant lament of their authors over the sins of the people,
the principal one, if the writer is a Catholic, being the refusal
to be sincerely reconciled with Rome; if Orthodox, it is
the neglect to give due honour to the saints. The deprecation
of ‘the just anger’ of God was on every one’s lips, and
priests of both Churches speak confidently as to the cause of
this anger. But assuredly, if the invocation of the celestial
hierarchy were ever desirable, it was so on this last evening
of the existence of the city as the Christian capital of the
East.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Last
religious
procession
in city.</div>

<p>A special solemn procession took place in the afternoon
through the streets of the city. Orthodox and Catholics,
bishops and priests, ordinary laymen, monks, women, children,
and indeed every person whose presence was not
required at the walls, took part in it, joined in every <i>Kyrie
Eleeson</i>, and responded with the sincerity of despair to
prayers imploring God not to allow them to fall into the
hands of the enemy. The sacred eikons and relics were
brought from the churches, were taken to the neighbourhoods
where the walls were most injured, and paraded with the
procession in the hope&mdash;to people of Northern climes and
the present century inexplicable and almost unthinkable&mdash;that
their display would avert the threatening danger.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake, however, to think that, because
these processions and the veneration of the sacred relics are
alien to modern modes of thought, they were not marked
with true religious sentiment, or even that they were useless.
They encouraged the fighters to go more bravely forth to
battle against tremendous odds, and they comforted both
them and non-combatants with the assurance that God was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>on their side. The archbishop concludes his account of this
last religious procession in the Christian city, on the eve of
the great struggle, by declaring that ‘we prayed that the
Lord would not allow His inheritance to be destroyed, that
He would deign in this contest to stretch forth His right
hand to deliver His faithful people, that He would show that
He alone is God and that there is none else beside Him [no
Allah of the Moslems] and that He would fight for the
Christians. And thus, placing our sole hope in Him, comforted
regarding what should happen on the day appointed
for battle, we waited for it with good courage.’</p>

<p>When the procession had completed its journey, the
emperor addressed a gathering of the nobles and military
leaders, Greeks and foreigners. Phrantzes gives at considerable
length the speech delivered by Constantine. Gibbon,

while describing it as ‘the funeral oration of the Roman
empire,’ suggests that the fullest version which exists of it,
that namely of Phrantzes, ‘smells so grossly of the sermon
and the convent’ as to make him doubt whether it was
pronounced by the emperor. We have, however, the other
summary given by Archbishop Leonard, who also was
probably present. Each account is given in the pedantic
form which is characteristic of mediaeval churchmen, Greeks
or Latins. The reporter always seems to think it necessary
to introduce classical allusions, to enlarge on the religious
aspect of the coming struggle, and to report in the first person.
But, bearing in mind this fashion of the time, and
recalling the fact that the accounts of Phrantzes and the
archbishop are independent, their records of the funeral
oration are substantially identical and do not vary more
than would do two independent reports written some months
after the delivery of a speech in our own time.</p>

<p>The emperor called attention to the impending assault,
reminded his hearers that it had always been held the duty
of a citizen to be ready to die either for his faith, his country,
his sovereign, or his wife and children, and pleaded that all
these incentives to heroic sacrifice were now combined. He
dwelt upon the importance of the city and their attachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
to it. It was the city of refuge for all Christians, the pride
and joy of every Greek and of all who lived in Eastern
lands. It was the Queen of Cities, the city which in happier
times had subdued nearly all the lands under the sun. The
enemy coveted it as his chief prize. He had provoked the
war. He had violated all his engagements in order to obtain
it. He wished to put the citizens under his yoke, to take
them as slaves, to convert the holy churches, where the
divine Trinity was adored and the most holy Godhead
worshipped, into shrines for his blasphemy, and to put the
false prophet in the place of Christ. He urged them as
brothers and fellow soldiers to fight bravely in the defence
of all that was dear to them, to remember that they were
the descendants of the heroes of ancient Greece and Rome,
and so to conduct themselves that their memory should be
as fragrant in the future as that of their ancestors. He
entrusted the city with confidence to their care. For himself
he was determined to die in its defence. He recalled to
them that he and they put their trust in God and not, as
did their enemy, in the multitude of his horsemen and his
hordes.</p>

<p>Both the reporters of this speech state that Constantine
concluded by addressing the Venetians and Genoese separately,
and, indeed, give the substance of what he said. He
recalled to each group their valiant services and the aid
they had rendered in times past and expressed his confidence
in their assistance on the morrow.</p>

<p>The emperor endeavoured to infuse hope and confidence
into all the leaders by pointing out that hitherto the
defenders had been able to hold the walls, that the invaders
were like wild animals and fought without intelligence, that
the shouts, the fires, and the great noise were a barbarous
attempt to frighten them, but that, protected by the walls,
he and his people with their brave Italian allies would be
more than a match for the invaders. ‘Do not lose heart,’
said he, ‘but comfort yourselves with bright hopes, because,
though few in number, you are skilled in warfare; strong,
brave and noble, and proved in valour.’ He concluded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
urging them once more to be daring and steadfast, and
promised that in such a cause, by the grace of God, they
would win.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p>We have nothing to enable us to judge whether the
emperor possessed the power of utterance which at various
periods in the world’s history has enabled great soldiers to
kindle the enthusiasm of their followers. If ever occasion
demanded such power, beyond doubt it was the present.
One advantage at least the orator possessed: he had an
audience entirely in sympathy with him. Whether he
succeeded or not in inspiring them with a confidence which
he can hardly have himself felt may be doubted. But that
all were determined to follow the emperor and to sacrifice
‘wives and children and their own lives’ in defence of him
and their ancient city is attested by both reporters. The
leaders, after the fashion still prevalent in Eastern Europe,
embraced and asked forgiveness of each other, as men who
were ready to die, and, solemnly devoting themselves to the
cause of the emperor, repaired to the great church of Hagia
Sophia, ‘to strengthen themselves by prayer and the reception
of the Holy Mysteries, to confirm their vows to fight, and,
if need be, unmindful of all worldly interests, to die for the
honour of God and of Christianity.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Last
Christian
service in
Hagia
Sophia.</div>

<p>The great ceremony of the evening and one that must
always stand out among the world’s historic spectacles was
the last Christian service held in the church of Holy Wisdom.
The great church had not been regularly used since the
meeting of December 12, which had led to so much heart-burning
and ill-will. Now, at the moment of supreme
danger for Constantinople, the fairest monument of Eastern
Christendom was again opened. The emperor and such of
the leaders as could be spared were present and the building
was once more and for the last time crowded with Christian
worshippers. It requires no great effort of imagination to
picture the scene. The interior of the church was the most
beautiful which Christian art had produced, and its beauty
was enhanced by its still gorgeous fittings. Patriarch and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>cardinal, the crowd of ecclesiastics representing both the
Eastern and Western Churches; emperor and nobles, the
last remnant of the once gorgeous and brave Byzantine
aristocracy; priests and soldiers intermingled, Constantinopolitans,
Venetians and Genoese, all were present, all
realising the peril before them, and feeling that in view of
the impending danger the rivalries which had occupied them
for years were too small to be worthy of thought. The
emperor and his followers partook together of ‘the undefiled
and divine mysteries,’ and said farewell to the patriarch.
The ceremony was in reality a liturgy of death. The
empire was in its agony and it was fitting that the service
for its departing spirit should be thus publicly said in its
most beautiful church and before its last brave emperor.
If the scene so vividly described by Mr. Bryce of the coronation
of Charles the Great and the birth of an empire is
among the most picturesque in history, that of the last Christian
service in St. Sophia is surely among the most tragic.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<p>The solemn ceremony concluded, all went to take up
their respective stations. The Greeks, says Leonard, who is
by no means a witness partial to them, went to their posts
strengthened in their manly resolve to put aside all private
interests and acted together for the common safety steadily
and cheerfully.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defenders
close gates
behind
them.</div>

<p>Italians and Greeks returned to their stations at the
landward walls for the defence of the Outer Wall and with the
Inner Wall behind them. In order to prevent any of their
number withdrawing from the fight the gates leading from
the city into the Peribolos, where they stood, were closed and
locked. They thus voluntarily cut themselves off from all
chance of retreat. It was done, says Cambini the Florentine,
writing while the siege was within the memory of persons
still living, so that in taking from the defenders any means
of retreat they should resolve to conquer or die.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p>During the night the defenders, and especially those
between the stockade and the Inner Wall, heard the noise of
great preparations among the enemy.</p>

<p>The emperor rode from Hagia Sophia to the palace of
Blachern, which he had occupied during all the time of the
siege. Phrantzes, who was in company with him, asks who
could remain unmoved while the emperor during his last
and short stay in the palace demanded pardon of all there
present. ‘If a man had been made of wood or stone he
must have wept over the scene.’</p>

<p>Depression is naturally the constant note of all the narratives
of those present in the city during May 28. The Venetian
closes the day’s entry by recording in a quaint passage
that the fasting and rejoicing among the Turkish army went
on until midnight, and that then the fires were extinguished,
but that these pagans all day and night continued to
beseech Mahomet that he would grant them victory and
help them to capture this city of Constantinople; ‘while we
Christians all day and night prayed God and St. Mary and
all the saints in heaven and with many tears devoutly
besought them that they would not grant such victory,
that the besieged should not become victims of this accursed
pagan,’ and thus ‘each side having prayed to its God, we to
ours and they to theirs, the Lord Almighty with his mother
in heaven decided that they must be avenged in this battle
of the morrow for all the sins committed.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emperor’s
last inspection
of
defenders.</div>

<p>Shortly after midnight of the 28th-29th the emperor,
accompanied by Phrantzes, left the palace of Blachern on
horseback to inspect the various stations and to see that all
were on the watch. The walls and towers were occupied;
the gates from the city into the Peribolos were safely closed,
so that none might enter or leave.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></p>

<p>When they came to Caligaria,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> probably on their return,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>they dismounted. They went up together into a tower
from which, assuming it to be the one at the corner where
the wall begins to descend towards the Golden Horn, which
would be that most suitable for their purpose, they would
have an uninterrupted view of the road and a considerable
stretch of ground on both sides of it leading to the Adrianople
or Chariseus Gate, while, looking in the other direction, they
could see the outside of a large portion of the walls towards
the Golden Horn and of the hill in front where the Crusaders
had encamped in 1203 and near or upon which Caraja was
at the head of the Bashi-bazouks. They heard the murmur
of many voices and the noise of many preparations and
were told by the guards that these sounds had continued
during all the night and were caused by the transport
of guns and other machines nearer to the ditch.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> It was
probably between one and two of the morning of the 29th
when Phrantzes and his imperial master separated; and
in all likelihood they never met again.</p>

<p>When the signal was given, the city was attacked simultaneously
on all three sides. The orders given by Mahomet
on the previous day had been strictly obeyed. The ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>during the night had taken up the positions assigned to
them on the sides of the Marmora and on the Golden Horn.
The armies on the landward side began simultaneously to
attempt the walls at several points.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></p>

<p class="center">Sketch Map showing the
disposition of Turkish Troops
during the last days of Siege;
May 1453.</p>

<p>The principal assault was in the Lycus valley and
against the stockade: where, says Tetaldi, twelve hundred
feet of barbican had been destroyed by the cannon; where,
adds Chalcondylas,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> four of the strongest towers had been
destroyed; where, says Ducas, the Outer Wall had been so
completely broken down that the besiegers and besieged could
see each other, and where, explains Critobulus, the Outer Wall
had been so entirely overthrown by the cannon that it was
no longer a wall but only a stockade built up with beams,
fascines, branches and the like, and barrels of earth.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></p>

<p>The defenders were between the stockade and the Inner
Wall. Here they had to defeat the enemy in front of them
or die. Mahomet’s intention was to concentrate his attack
on the stockade and on the walls between the Adrianople Gate
and Tekfour Serai and to deal blow after blow against them
with the whole of his available force while making sufficient
show of attack elsewhere to draw away the defenders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assault
begun by
Bashi-bazouks.</div>

<p>The assault was commenced by the Bashi-bazouks, the
most worthless portion of Mahomet’s army, who came up
for this purpose from the northern end of the landward
walls. Many among them were Moslems, but there were so
many Christians and foreigners that Barbaro calls them all
Christians.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> Leonard declares that among them were Germans,
Hungarians, and other foreigners of various kinds.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a>
Mahomet’s object in sending forward these men to make
the first attack was mainly that they might exhaust the
strength and the ammunition of the besieged. This, indeed,
was his method of utilising his superiority in numbers.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Moreover, says Barbaro, he preferred that these Christians
should be killed rather than his Mussulmans. The Bashi-bazouks
advanced bearing all the scaling-ladders within
shooting distance of the walls and probably extended themselves
from Tekfour Serai to the stockade and beyond to
Top Capou. They began the fight with a general discharge
of arrows, of stones from slings, and iron and leaden balls.
Then, with a wild disorderly dash, they rushed across the
ditch and endeavoured to capture the Outer Wall and
especially the stockade. They were armed in ways as
numerous and varied as the races and creeds to which
they belonged: some with bows, others with slings, with
arquebuses or with muskets,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> but most of them simply with
scimitars and shields. Hundreds of ladders were placed
against the walls and the bravest hastened to climb them.
Others, mounted on the shoulders of their comrades, endeavoured
to reach the summit or to strike at the defenders.
In the darkness of this night attack, made by fifty thousand
men, there was soon wild confusion everywhere, but
especially in the valley to which for the present the action
in my story is confined. At every point the invaders met
with a brave resistance. While among the attacking party
there were many who had no heart for the fight,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> there were
others who were not deficient in courage, but they had to
meet the best soldiers in the emperor’s army, a band of two
thousand Greeks and Italians all under the leadership of
Justiniani, ‘the incomparable captain, the mighty man and
genuine soldier.’</p>

<p>The defenders threw the ladders down, discharged
their arrows, fired their muskets and culverins,<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> and hurled
down a prodigious quantity of stones. The assailants were
so numerous and so crowded together that the missiles of
the besieged told heavily against them. The bravest who
succeeded in climbing within striking distance were struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>down. The resistance was so stubborn that many began to
give way. But they had not yet sufficiently served their
purpose. Until their strength was exhausted, Mahomet
would not consent that they should cease to exhaust that of
the defenders. Those who attempted to withdraw found
themselves between the devil and the deep sea. A body of
Turkish chaouses had been told off with iron maces and
loaded whips to drive back any endeavouring to retreat, and
behind them again were stationed Janissaries ready with
their scimitars to cut down any who should succeed in
escaping through the line of chaouses. In this manner
the fight was prolonged for between one and two hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They are
beaten
back.</div>

<p>But in spite of all that could be done, in spite of
numbers and of courage, Mahomet’s first division was
beaten back with many killed and wounded. Having
served its purpose in exhausting the strength of the small
body of the defenders, it was allowed to withdraw. Some
of the besieged appear to have considered the attack rather
as an attempt to surprise the city by a night alarm than as
part of the expected general assault. They were indeed weary
with hard fighting and hard work. For forty days they had
hardly known a single hour of rest,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> and they hoped for it, at
least until the morning. They were soon undeceived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anatolian
division
next
attack.</div>

<p>Amid the darkness of the early summer morning a
division of Anatolian Turks could be distinguished pouring
over the ridge on which stands Top Capou. It was the
advance of disciplined men, distinguishable by their breastplates,
and their arrival made the situation much more
serious. Here, indeed, was the general assault which all
expected at daylight. The bells throughout the city again
sounded everywhere an alarm; all the inhabitants were at
their posts. As the Anatolians came across the ditch up to
the stockade the struggle began once more in deadly earnest.
Trumpets, fifes, and drums sounded their loudest to encourage
the assailants. Besiegers and besieged shouted and
roared at each other. Prayers for help, imprecations, clang
of bells within the city, roar of guns and small cannon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>within and without made up the pandemonium of a storming
party. Ladders were once more placed against the walls
and were hurled back; men scrambled on each other’s
shoulders trying hard to reach the summit of the stockade.
‘Our men’ are continually throwing down stones and are
resisting hand to hand all who attempt to scale or destroy
it. ‘More Turks were killed,’ says Barbaro, ‘than you would
have thought possible.’</p>

<p>Now the great cannon, which during the night had been
advanced as near the wall as possible, is brought into play.
An hour before daylight a well-directed shot from the
monster was aimed at the stockade, struck it and brought
a portion of it down. Under cover of the dust from the
falling stones and barrels of earth, but especially of the
dense black smoke of the powder, a band of Turks rushed
forward and, before they could be prevented, three hundred
had entered the enclosure. The Greeks and Italians resisted
manfully, fought fiercely to expel them, killed many and
drove the remainder out.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> The besieged raised shouts of
triumph. The emperor was with his soldiers, always
showing himself in the thick of the fighting, urging men by
voice and cheering them by his example. This second
attack was more systematic, fiercer, more desperate than
the first. The Turks had no need of men behind them to
prevent their retreat or to urge them forward. Shouting
their wild battle-cry of Allah! Allah! they rushed on in the
darkness as men who, if they do not court death, at least do
not fear it; as men who believe they are fighting for God,
and that in case of death they will be at once transported to
a combined heavenly and earthly paradise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They, too,
are driven
back.</div>

<p>In spite of the discipline and daring of the Anatolian
troops, of the stimulus derived from their fanatical creed
and from the special promise of reward here and hereafter
to those who should succeed in entering the Queen City
or should perish in the attempt, the assault by them failed
as completely as had that of the Bashi-bazouks. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>stubborn bravery of a comparatively small number of Greeks
and Italians behind the hastily formed stockade and the
battered, thousand-year-old walls were so far more than a
match for the invaders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assaults
in other
places also
fail.</div>

<p>The success of the attackers was up to the present not
more complete in other parts of the city. Zagan Pasha
had made desperate attempts to scale the walls near the
west end of the Horn under cover of showers of arrows and
other missiles from the ships and from large pontoons
drawn up as near as possible to the walls, but had been
defeated by Trevisano. Caraja Pasha, north of the Adrianople
Gate, had crossed the foss and made a vigorous attempt
against the walls broken down by the cannon between that
Gate and the Palace of Porphyrogenitus, now known as
Tekfour Serai.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> But that district, ‘the high part of the
Myriandrion,’<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> was held by the three brothers Bocchiardi,
who had borne the cost of their men at their own charge,
and who covered themselves, says Leonard, with eternal
glory, fighting like Horatius Cocles and his companions
who kept the bridge of old. Their neighbours at Tekfour
Serai and around the southern portion of Caligaria under
the Venetian bailey Minotto,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> had been equally successful.
All the invaders’ attempts had been defeated. Critobulus
is justified in commenting with pride on the defeat of this
second attack. ‘The Romans, indeed, proved themselves
very valiant; for nothing could shake them, neither hunger
nor want of rest, nor weariness from continuous fighting,
nor wounds, nor the thought of the slaughter of their
families which menaced them. Nothing could alter their
determination to be faithful to their trust.’</p>

<p>There remained but one more chance&mdash;on May 29 at
least&mdash;of capturing the city by general assault. Two
divisions had failed. But Mahomet noted that his plan of
attack by successive divisions had greatly weakened the
defenders at the stockade. He therefore decided to put
forth all his strength and to send forward his reserves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span></p>

<p>These consisted of the <i>élite</i> of his army, the veteran warriors
of his bodyguard, infantry bearing shields and pikes, a body
of archers, another of lancers, and, more skilled and more
<span class="sidenote">Assault by Janissaries.</span>
trustworthy than all, his body of twelve thousand Janissaries.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a>
These reserves were now to attempt the assault at the
stockade under the immediate leadership of their great
commander, while the remainder of the army made a
simultaneous attack against other portions of the landward
walls.</p>

<p>Mahomet began the new assault with the utmost care.
Dawn was now supplying sufficient light<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> to enable him to
superintend a more elaborate plan. The assault was not to
be a mere wild rush and scramble. Having urged his guards
to show their valour, Mahomet put himself at their head
and led them as far as the foss.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></p>

<p>At the moment, says Barbaro, when the defenders were
rejoicing at having driven out the three hundred from the
barbicans, the pagans again fired their big gun and under
cover of the smoke and dust the besiegers advanced. A huge
but orderly crowd of archers, slingers, and musketeers discharged
their arrows and other missiles. Successive volleys
were steadily fired upon the Greeks and Italians defending the
whole length of the stockade, so that they could hardly show
a head over the battlements without being struck. The
missiles fell in numbers, says Critobulus, like rain. They
darkened the sky, says Leonard. When the defenders had
been thrown into some confusion by this long hail of
missiles, Mahomet gave the signal for advance to his ‘fresh,
vigorous, and invincible’ Janissaries. They rushed across
the foss and attempted as their predecessors had done, to
carry the stockade by storm.</p>

<p>Ten thousand of these ‘grand masters and valiant men,’
says Barbaro, with admiration for a brave enemy, ‘ran to
the walls, not like Turks, but like lions.’ Fighting in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>presence of their sovereign, says Critobulus, they never lost
their dash, but fought like men possessed and as if life were
of no value. They tried to tear down the stockade; to
break or pull down the great barrels of earth which crowned it;
to drag out the beams and thus break down or make a passage
through into the Enclosure; to climb over it on the scaling-ladders
which once placed against the wall were immediately
crowded with assailants. Their shouts and yells, their calls
upon Allah, the noise of their drums, fifes, and trumpets,
the roar of the culverins and cannon once more struck
terror into the affrighted citizens and were heard, says
Barbaro, across the Bosporus. For a while all was mad
confusion.</p>

<p>We do not need the confirmation of Barbaro and Critobulus
of the statement that the Greeks and Italians were
worn out with their long defence before the attack by the
Janissaries commenced. They had been hewing and hacking,
throwing down stones and hurling back ladders for nearly,
or perhaps quite, three hours and were unequal to contend
with many times their numbers of men ardent and fresh
for battle. But they knew, as indeed did every one within
the city, that the crisis of the attack was at hand, and they
manfully fought on. The church bells added to the din:
the alarm bells on the walls were calling for every available
help. Women and children, monks and nuns, were either
assisting to bring stones to their friends on the walls or were
on their knees praying that their great city should not fall
into the hands of the pagans. Justiniani and his little band
met the attack with lances, axes, pikes, and swords, and cut
down the foremost of their assailants. For a short time the
fight became a hard hand-to-hand encounter, neither party
gaining any advantage over the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kerkoporta
incident.</div>

<p>Contemporaneously with this latter portion of the
struggle in the Lycus valley, an incident, possibly of
supreme importance, was taking place about half a mile to
the northward.</p>

<p>Of the three ways into the city which Mahomet declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
he had opened for his troops, one was to the north of the
Adrianople Gate. The walls between this gate and the
Palace of Porphyrogenitus were, in construction, like those
in the Lycus valley, but the inner Theodosian wall, instead
of extending as far as that palace (now known as Tekfour
Serai), stopped short about a hundred yards from it. There
a short wall at right angles connected it with the second
or Outer Wall. In this transverse wall was a postern giving
access from the city to the Inner Enclosure or Peribolos. The
short Outer Wall north of the transverse wall, having to do
duty for the two city walls, had been made exceptionally
strong. A small postern gate, partly below the level of the
ground and underneath the extremity of the palace,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> led
directly from the city to the Outer Enclosure. This gate
was known as the Kerkoporta or Circus Gate.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> It had been
built up and almost forgotten for many years previous to
the siege, but when easy access to the Outer Enclosure was
deemed necessary, certain old men recalled its existence and
it was reopened. As its position caused it to be concealed
from persons who were not close to the tower, it
may easily have been left undefended for a while during
the night under the impression that it would not be
noticed.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>The Outer Wall between the Kerkoporta and the Adrianople
Gate had been largely damaged and a breach made
which had been stormed unsuccessfully during the night.
The Turks had here also, as well as near the Romanus Gate,
been able to pass the ditch and take possession of the
Outer Enclosure.</p>

<p>As daylight approached, some of the enemy noticed that
the Kerkoporta had been left open. A number of Janissaries
(stated by Ducas to be fifty) hastened through and took possession
of it. They were soon followed by others, who gained
access to the Inner Enclosure first through the Kerkoporta
and then through the neighbouring postern already mentioned
in the transverse wall, the distance between the two posterns
being about thirty yards. They surprised and attacked
those who were occupied in resisting the attempts of Caraja’s
main division to storm the breach or scale the Outer
Wall. Every foot they captured allowed their numbers to
be increased by comrades who could now climb the Outer
Wall without opposition or who crowded in through the
Kerkoporta and the postern in the transverse wall. The
besieged, overwhelmed by numbers, and having their retreat
into the city through the postern cut off, fled towards the
Adrianople Gate, the postern of which was soon blocked by
the crowd, the stronger trampling upon the weaker, so that
presently all egress from the Enclosure was impossible. A
slaughter took place and a few Turks entered the city, while
others mounted the walls, pulled down the emperor’s flags
and those of St. Mark and replaced them by the Turkish
standards.</p>

<p>The entry of the Turks by the Kerkoporta is only related
by Ducas, but it is incidentally confirmed by the fact mentioned
by Phrantzes and other writers, that while the struggle
in the Lycus valley was going on, the Turkish standards
were raised on the towers to the north of the Adrianople Gate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>before an entry had been effected elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> Critobulus’s
statement that Caraja’s men crossed the foss, made a vigorous
assault, and sought to pass within the broken-down (Outer)
wall, but were repulsed, probably refers to the same incident.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a>
Ducas is careful to state that the emperor and the Romans
did not know what had happened, because they were at some
distance and were too much occupied in defending themselves
in a different place, which he explains to be where the wall
had been broken down: that is, at the stockade in the Lycus
valley. While they were thus fighting, he says, to resist the
entry through the ruined wall, God willed that the enemy
should enter the city by this other way. Leonard mentions
that the arrangements for sending messengers from one part
of the wall to another were defective. The emperor, however,
was probably informed of the entry by the Kerkoporta
and of the capture of at least part of the enclosure between
that postern and the Adrianople Gate, and hastened thither
before his army under Justiniani learned that the Turkish
standards had been hoisted on the towers near the Adrianople
Gate.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> The few Turks who had entered the city, bent
upon plunder, made for the rich monasteries of Choras and
St. John in Petra and the Blachern palace; but it would
appear that the brothers Bocchiardi were able to regain
possession of the Enclosure and to prevent any considerable
number of the enemy from following those who had entered
the Kerkoporta. Possibly even they were strong enough
to close it. The fact that the entry at the Kerkoporta
is not mentioned by Critobulus may be taken to confirm
the view that, if he knew of it at all, he only regarded it as
a somewhat unimportant incident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime in the Enclosure in the Lycus valley the
struggle was being bravely fought out with pikes, axes,
javelins, long lances and swords, for now, as Critobulus is
careful to inform us, ‘the fight was hand-to-hand.’<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> The
obstinate resistance of the little band of Greeks and Italians
appears to have met with some success. The attack by the
Janissaries and the rest of the sultan’s own division had so
far failed and was weakening.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John
Justiniani
wounded.</div>

<p>It was at this moment that one of those fateful accidents
occurred which have at times decided the destiny of nations.
John Justiniani, who under the emperor was in supreme
command, was severely wounded. He bled profusely,
and determined to leave his command in order to obtain
medical aid. The wound was so severe that it proved mortal
within a few days. But those present did not recognise its
gravity. Some of his contemporaries deny that it was
sufficiently grave to justify his leaving the field, but Critobulus,
writing some years afterwards, states that he had to
be carried away.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> Leonard and Phrantzes say that when
the emperor was informed of his determination to enter
the city, Constantine besought and implored him not to
do so but to return to his post, endeavouring to persuade
him that the wound was slight and pointing out that his
departure would demoralise not only his own men but the
Greeks, and strongly urged that the fate of the city depended
on his remaining. Justiniani, however, pleaded the pain of
his wound, demanded that the key of the gate leading into
the city should be given to his men,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> and insisted upon
leaving the Peribolos or Enclosure, promising to return when
his wound had been attended to. The keys of a small gate
which Justiniani had caused to be opened in the Inner Wall
to give easier access to the Enclosure behind the stockade
were brought and he entered the city.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span></p>

<p>The story told by Chalcondylas is that in reply to the
emperor’s question whither he was going, Justiniani said
that he was going where God Himself had opened a way for
the Turks. It may well be doubted. He was accompanied,
say Critobulus and others, by his own men, a statement,
however, which can hardly apply to the whole four hundred.
The unlocking of the gate proved at once to be a dangerous
temptation to soldiers who had been fighting continuously
for hours and who had seen the departure of their leader.
Justiniani made his way to his ship, which was stationed at
the boom, and escaped to Chios, where he died within a
few days&mdash;or possibly on the way thither.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Justiniani’s
departure
creates a
panic.</div>

<p>His departure was calamitous and at once created a panic.
He was a commander who had the full confidence of those
under him, and his absence struck dismay into their hearts.
Barbaro says that it was through his flight that the shout
was then raised, ‘The Turks have got in;’ that everybody
then cried in alarm to God for mercy, and that men wept
like women. It was through him, and ‘he lied in his throat,
because they had not yet got in.’<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> Leonard, himself a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Genoese, who speaks of Justiniani with warm admiration,
is hardly less severe upon him in regard to his manner of
leaving the fight. He declares that, as he had at first shown
courage, now he displayed cowardice. He ought to have
borne the pain and remained, or at least to have appointed
some one in his place. The spirit of his followers was broken
by his desertion. The Podestà of Pera, also a Genoese,
seems himself to have condemned his departure. He says
the enemy was opposed right manfully, but Justiniani
deserted his gate, and withdrew to the sea, and by that
gate the Turks entered without resistance. Remembering
that this is the testimony of the chief Genoese official against
the great Genoese captain, it may be regarded as reflecting
the general opinion of the time.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> We, however, may well
remember that Justiniani had remained in the city with his
men, had worked day and night at the repairs of the walls,
had, by the testimony of all, been the great organiser of the
defence, and, knowing that he died of his wounds, may be
charitable enough to believe that he did not desert his post
except under the pressure of pain too great to be endured.</p>

<p>It is beyond doubt that his departure demoralised both
the foreigners who remained and the brave little band of
Greeks who had borne with them the brunt of the fighting.
Leonard asserts that when his countrymen saw themselves
without a leader, they began to abandon their posts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emperor
tries to
rally
defenders
of
stockade.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the emperor, behind the stockade, was endeavouring
to rally his men, and fighting with a courage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>worthy of his great name. He himself took the post of Justiniani
and led the defending party. He had no other men
to replace those who had left, but he rallied the Greeks and
the remainder of the Genoese and Venetians, and with his
own small bodyguard rushed to the stockade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Final
charge of
Janissaries.</div>

<p>Mahomet witnessed, from the opposite side of the foss,
the demoralisation caused by the departure of Justiniani.
He noted that the stockade and broken walls had fewer
defenders, that many of them were secretly slipping away,
and that those who remained were fighting less vigorously.
He saw that the opportune moment for him had come and,
calling out to his men, ‘We have the city: it is ours already;
the wall is undefended,’ urged his Janissaries to fear nothing,
but follow him, and the city would be captured.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> At his
bidding and under his lead, the Janissaries hastened once
more to rush the stockade and to climb upon the <i>débris</i> of
the wall destroyed by the gun.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>The sultan had promised great rewards to the first who
should gain a position on the wall. A stalwart Janissary
named Hassan gained this honour. A man of gigantic
stature, he was able, while holding his shield in his left hand,
to fight his way to the top of the broken wall, and was
followed by some thirty others. The Greeks resisted their
entry and killed eighteen. But Hassan maintained his
position long enough to enable some of his followers to
climb up and get over the wall. A fierce skirmish took
place, and many were killed on both sides. Hassan himself
was wounded by a stone, slipped and fell, fought bravely
on his knees, but was overpowered and killed.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> But the
discrepancy in numbers was too great. Once a few were able
to maintain their position on the wall, the Turks mounted
and got over to the inner side of the stockade in crowds.
The remnant of the defending army stood their ground for
a while, but the invaders drove a number of them back and
into the deep ditch which had been dug between the great
wall and the stockade and out of which it was difficult to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>escape.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> Many were thus killed within the Peribolos, of
which for the first time the Turks were now the masters.
Some of the invaders climbed the great wall behind the
defenders to hurl down stones on them, and a fierce fight
went on along the length of the stockade in the Lycus
valley, and possibly indeed along the whole length of the
walls in the Mesoteichion. Suddenly, in this the supreme
moment of the struggle, shouts were heard both within and
without the walls and from the direction of the harbour,
shouts which were taken up by the Greeks, Ἑάλω ἡ πόλις:
‘the city is taken; the Turkish flags are flying on the towers.’</p>

<p>We have already seen what had happened to cause this
cry to be raised. The detachment of Turks who had gained
entrance through the Kerkoporta had captured some of the
lofty towers between it and the Adrianople Gate, and had
there raised the Turkish standards.</p>

<p>‘“The city is captured!” the cry sent dismay into the
hearts of our men, but encouraged the enemy.’<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> It was not
true, says Barbaro. The city was not then taken. But
meantime the Turks were now up and over the walls in
crowds. Within a quarter of an hour, says Barbaro, of their
first obtaining possession of the stockade there must have
been thirty thousand of them within the Peribolos.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stockade
captured.</div>

<p>The success of the Janissaries in overcoming the first
serious line of defence<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> was followed up instantly by the
other Turkish troops. The news of the entry across the
stockade seems to have spread like wildfire, and though it is
difficult to believe the statement of Barbaro that the Enclosure
was filled from one end of the walls to the other with
seventy thousand of the hostile army, it is possible that
the vigour which follows success enabled the Janissaries
and other portions of the army to obtain entry at once into
the Enclosure at various other places. Some of the defenders
fled in panic and made for the small gate through which
Justiniani had retired, the only one behind them which was
open. They rushed on in such haste as to trample each
other down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment the emperor, who had been called off to
the northern end of the valley to learn the meaning of the
display of the Turkish flags and to resist the inrush of the
invaders who had entered by the Kerkoporta, returned.
Spurring his horse, he galloped down the Enclosure to the
stockade where the Turks were crowding in,<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> and tried to
rally the remainder of the defenders. Calling upon his men
to follow him, he threw off his imperial insignia, drew his
sword, sprang into the thick of the fight, and attempted to
<span class="sidenote">Death of Constantine.</span>
drive the invaders back.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> With Don Francisco of Toledo
on his right, Theophilus Palaeologus and John Dalmata on
his left, his own sword broken, he endeavoured to check the
advancing crowd. Theophilus shouted that he would rather
die than live. The four checked for a moment the inrush of
the Turks, slew some of them, and cut their way to the wall
where the Turks were pouring in. But they were hopelessly
outnumbered. The emperor was lost sight of amid the
crowd. He and his companions fell fighting, and the enemy
continued to pour through the breaches.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></p>

<p>Once the enemy had obtained entrance into the Enclosure
the defenders were in a trap. The only exit into the city
open to them was by the small gate through which Justiniani
had passed. The Military Gate of St. Romanus, the Gate
of the Assault, remained locked. A heap of slain, Genoese
and Greeks,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> near it made escape impossible. The defeat of
<span class="sidenote">City captured May 29.</span>
the survivors of the gallant band which Justiniani had led
was forthwith completed by a body of the Janissaries who
entered the Enclosure across the broken stockade, formed
themselves in regular order, and swept everything before
them.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> Their overwhelming numbers soon enabled them
to kill all opponents who had not escaped into the city.
The great wall being partly broken down and without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>defenders, and the Gate of St. Romanus being forced or
opened, access to the city was easy. A band made their way
to the Adrianople Gate, which they opened from the inside,
and the city was from that moment in the power of the
enemy.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></p>

<p>As the sun rose Mahomet saw that his great effort had
succeeded. Where Arabs, with even greater numbers than
he commanded, in the first flush of the victorious career of
Islam, with the presence of the great Eyoub, the companion
of the Prophet, to encourage them and to speak of the
wondrous rewards which Paradise had in store for the
believers who should enter New Rome or die in the attempt;
where Murad thirty years before; and where twenty
other besieging armies had been unable to capture the
world’s capital, he had succeeded. Seated on horseback
beneath his great standard and insignia, he watched with
the legitimate pride of a conqueror the entry of his hordes
into the city.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> The morning sun shed its rays upon him
and his standard as his soldiers thronged through the Gate
of the Assault or hastened towards that of Adrianople. The
entry was not long after sunrise and probably between five
and six o’clock.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of
city due
to two
accidents.</div>

<p>If credit is to be given to the story of the entry of the
Turks at the Kerkoporta as related by Ducas, then it may
be said that the capture of the city was due to two accidents:
the leaving open of that gate and the wound of Justiniani.
It is beyond doubt that the immediate cause of the capture
was the withdrawal of John Justiniani, followed by the flight
of a considerable number of his men.</p>

<p>In the words of Cambini, a contemporary of the siege,
but writing at a sufficiently remote period to look calmly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>upon the events he narrates, Justiniani had so conducted
himself that, until he was wounded, every one looked to him
for the salvation of the city, and upon his quitting the battlefield
the courage of those whom he led failed them.</p>

<p>Whatever hypothesis as to the character of his wound
be accepted, whether when urged by the emperor he could
have remained or not, his departure was an irretrievable
misfortune. Few as were the defenders when compared
with the great host attacking, they had never altogether
lost hope. The Podestà of Galata, writing within a month
of the capture of the city, declares that he and the Genoese
longed for the general attack, because victory for the Christians
appeared certain.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> On the other hand, there is reason to
believe that the besiegers were far from confident of being
able to capture it. There was, as we have seen, a strong
peace party in Mahomet’s camp headed by Halil Pasha.
The reports were well founded of a fleet in the Archipelago
on its way to the city. Thirty ships sent by the pope had
arrived at Chios and were awaiting favourable winds at the
time they heard of the success of Mahomet.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></p>

<p>There were rumours of a Hungarian army coming to
attack them in the rear. The emperor had promised to give
Selymbria to Hunyadi in return for his aid. Some inkling
of the arrangement may have reached the sultan. The king
of Catalonia had made an agreement with Constantine in
return for the island of Lemnos.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> It is in the highest degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>probable that Mahomet believed that if any of these forces
should arrive before Constantinople either by land or by sea, he
would have to abandon the siege. With these possible dangers
threatening him, it is not unreasonable to conclude that if
the besieged could have succeeded in repulsing the Turks in
their greatest attack, and have held the city for even one day
longer, Mahomet himself would have considered it necessary
to withdraw his army, and Constantinople might possibly
have been saved for Europe. Hence the withdrawal of
Justiniani was an event of supreme importance. It led to
the capture and decided the fate of the city, and gave the
death-blow to the Eastern Empire. The ships bringing help,
which were on their way, were too late. One is almost driven
to the belief of Pusculus, ‘Auxilium Deus ipse negavit.’<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Constantine.</div>

<p>In the struggle which took place, the emperor bore a part
worthy of his name and of his position. He perished among
his own subjects and the remnant of the Latins who
were aiding him. Whether the story related by Ducas
and Leonard, that the emperor asked if there was no
Christian willing to kill him, be true or not, there can be no
doubt that he met his death like a brave man. All accounts
attest his courage. Critobulus states that when he saw that
the enemy had succeeded and were pouring through the
breaches in the walls, he shouted, ‘The city is taken and I
am still alive,’ and thereupon dashed into the midst of the
enemy and was killed.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Manner of
his death.</div>

<p>The manner of his death is, however, doubtful. No contemporary
writer was present. Phrantzes, who had attended
him at and after midnight, expressly tells us that he had
been sent on duty elsewhere. Critobulus states that the
emperor fell near the postern which Justiniani had opened
from the city to the stockade;<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> Leonard, that he was struck
down by a Janissary, recovered himself, was again struck
down and killed.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> Ducas declares that two Turks claimed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>have killed the emperor and to have taken his head, which
was recognised by Notaras, and that it was placed on a column
in the Augusteum, then stuffed and sent to be shown in
Persia, Arabia, and Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> The story of Ducas is to
a certain extent confirmed by the Moscovite, who states that
a scribe brought the head of the emperor to Mahomet, who,
when he was assured that it was genuine, kissed it and then
sent it to the patriarch. It was then encased in a silver
vase and buried under the altar of St. Sophia. He adds
that the body was carried in the night to Galata and there
buried.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> To some extent their story is confirmed by Pusculus,
who says that in struggling with the Janissaries ‘at the
mound,’ where he killed three Turks, he was slain by the
mighty stroke of a sword; that his head was cut off from his
shoulders by one who knew him, and taken to Mahomet,
who paid the promised reward.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> None of these stories as to
the manner of death can be regarded as altogether trustworthy.
Barbaro, with the sailor-like bluntness which
usually characterises his matter-of-fact statements when not
attacking the Genoese, says, ‘No news was received of his
fate, whether he was living or dead, but some say that his
body was seen among the number of the dead, while others
asserted that he was trampled to death at the entry which
the Turks made at the gate of St. Romanus.’ Phrantzes,
who, like Barbaro, was in the city at the time, records that,
after the capture, the sultan caused diligent search to be
made to learn whether the emperor was alive or dead; that
men were sent to seek among the heaps of the slain; that many
heads were washed, but no one could recognise that of the
emperor; but that a body was found which had the imperial
eagles embroidered on the socks and greaves, and that this
body was given over to the Christians to be buried with due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>honours. Phrantzes<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> does not profess to have seen the body,
and makes no mention of the head having been brought to
the sultan and recognised by Notaras the Grand Duke, as
stated by Ducas. Tetaldi confirms the statement that the
emperor died at the time of the assault. He adds, ‘Some
say that he had his head sliced off; others that he died at the
gate <i>en s’en cuidant yssir</i>. Either story may be true. He
died in the throng, and the Turks would have cut off his
head.’</p>

<p>Against the version of Phrantzes is to be placed the fact
that his tomb is unknown and that no contemporary&mdash;or,
indeed, subsequent&mdash;writer mentions where it was. Had it
existed, it is not likely to have been forgotten by the Greeks.
Had the body been purposely buried in a secret place, there
would probably have grown up a legend about it which
would have kept its memory green.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of Constantine.</div>

<p>Constantine Palaeologus Dragases in the fiftieth year
of his age disappears amid the final charge of the Turkish
Janissaries. Although there were rumours of his escape,
his death within the Inner Enclosure of the Lycus valley
cannot reasonably be doubted. His conduct during the
whole of the siege had earned respect. He had done his
best to encourage his subjects to fight bravely, had stimulated
them by his speech and by his example. He had spared
no exertion day and night to organise the defence, had tried to
reconcile hostile parties and to unite all for the common safety.
When the long-standing jealousies and rivalries between
his own subjects and the citizens of the two republics
threatened to weaken the force available for the defence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>the city, it was he who by his personal influence and the
respect and even affection which he had acquired and inspired
persuaded them to postpone their quarrels. Fanatical
Greeks and equally fanatical Catholics had almost forgotten
for the time their animosities and had joined forces for the
honour of God and for the defence of Christianity. At his
instigation, Roman cardinal and Orthodox bishops had
thrown themselves energetically into the common labour of
resisting the Moslem hordes. At his entreaty the task of
completing the Union of the Churches was by common
accord allowed to stand over. The example of the religious
chiefs was followed by their flocks. Whenever we are
able to get a glimpse of the emperor’s personality we see
him as a man without conspicuous ability but whose devotion
to his country was complete, whose sympathy made
friends of all who were brought into contact with him, and
won for him the admiration of his own troops and of the
brave Italians who fought under him. His refusal to leave
the city when urged to do so by the patriarch and other
leaders both of the Church and people was the more praiseworthy
when it is remembered that the arguments in favour
of departure were at least plausible, and that he had apparently
come to the conclusion that, in spite of all his
exertions, Mahomet would succeed in capturing it.</p>

<p>He was holding the last great stronghold of Eastern
Christianity against the attempt of Islam to capture that
which in the eyes of all Moslems represented the capital of
Christendom. The steadfastness and tenacity with which
the imperial city had maintained its lordship for upwards
of a thousand years and had during the whole of that period
served as a bulwark against the invasion of Europe by
Asiatic hordes were worthily represented in its last emperor.
Various causes, for which he can in no way be held responsible,
had sapped the strength of the city and made its
capture possible, but with a Roman obstinacy that would
have done honour to the best of his predecessors he
deliberately chose not to abandon it but to die in its defence.
To his eternal honour it must be said that, despairing of or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
not considering the question of ultimate success, he never
wavered, never omitted any precaution to deserve victory,
but fought on heroically to the end and finally sacrificed his
life for his people, his country and Christendom. The exact
spot where he lies buried is unknown, but, in the bold
metaphor, quoted as already old by the great consort of
Justinian, he judged that ‘the empire was an excellent
winding-sheet.’<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> His death was a fitting and honourable
end of the Eastern Roman Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Entry of

army.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> author of the Turkish Taj-ut-Tavarikh or ‘Crown of
History,’ written by Khodja Sad-ud-din, states that after the
sultan’s troops had forced a way into the city&mdash;not, as he is
careful to explain, through any of the gates, but across the
broken wall between Top Capou and the Adrianople Gate&mdash;they
went round and opened the neighbouring gates from the
inside, and that the first so opened was the Adrianople Gate.
Then the army entered through these gates in regular order,
division by division.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a></p>

<p>While the principal assault was that made under the
sultan’s own eyes in the Lycus valley, the city had been elsewhere
simultaneously attacked. Though all other attacks
sink into insignificance beside this, yet they are deserving of
notice. The most important were those made by Zagan Pasha
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>from one or more large and specially constructed pontoons
which had been brought as close as possible to the walls
at the western end of the Golden Horn and by Caraja
Pasha between the Adrianople Gate and Tekfour Serai.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attacks by
Zagan and
Caraja fail.</div>

<p>Zagan had brought all his division across the bridge near
Aivan Serai, and his soldiers, during the early morning, had
made a continuous series of attempts to scale the walls from
the narrow strip of land between them and the water, while
his archers and fusiliers attempted to cover the attacking
parties from the pontoons. His efforts were aided by the
crews on board the seventy ships which had been transported
across Pera Hill and which were now stationed at
intervals extending from the pontoons to the Phanar. They
were stoutly and successfully opposed by Gabriel Trevisano,
who had charge of the walls upon the Horn as far as the
Phanar.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<p>Caraja’s vigorous assault, as has been already mentioned,
was at one of the three places where Mahomet boasted that
his cannon had made a way into the city. It was probably
a part of his division which had followed the discoverers of
the open Kerkoporta into the city. Zagan and Caraja were,
however, defeated.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">460</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">By fleet
also.</div>

<p>The Turkish fleet under Hamoud had done its part elsewhere.
During the night it had come in force to the boom
and had taken up a position parallel to it. When, however,
the admiral saw that there were against him ten great and
other smaller ships, all ready for the defence, he carried out
the orders which had been given on the previous evening,
passed round Seraglio Point, and took up a position opposite
the walls on the side of the Marmora, where the caloyers
or monks were among the defenders. But all the efforts of
the Turks in the fleet on the side of the Marmora failed to
effect an entrance. Small as was the number of the men
dispersed along the walls, they held their own and repulsed
all attempts to scale them. It was only when they saw the
Turks in their rear that they recognised that their struggle
had been in vain. Then, indeed, some flung themselves in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>despair from the walls; others surrendered in hope of saving
their lives. The walls were abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> Once the Turks
had succeeded in effecting their entry through the stockade
in the Lycus valley, followed as such entry was by the
marching in of the divisions through the ordinary gates, the
defence of the city was hopeless.</p>

<p>Probably among the earliest from the fleet to effect an
entry were men who appear to have landed at the Jews’
quarter, which was near the Horaia Gate on the side of the
Golden Horn.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></p>

<p>The two brothers Paul and Troilus Bocchiardi in the
highest part of the Myriandrion, near the Adrianople Gate,
maintained their resistance for some time after they had
observed that the Turks were pouring in on their left.
Seeing that further resistance was useless, they determined
to look after their own safety and to make for the ships. In
doing so they were surrounded, but fought their way through
the enemy and escaped to Galata.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> Greeks and Latins alike,
who were defending the walls on the Marmora and Golden
Horn, judged that it was now impossible to hold them.
From the latter position they could see that the Venetian
and imperial flags which had waved over the towers from
the Adrianople Gate down to the sea had been replaced by
the Turkish ensigns. They were, indeed, soon attacked in
the rear. The crews of the Turkish ships, likewise learning
from the hoisting of the Turkish flags in lieu of those of St.
Mark and the empire that their comrades were already
within the city, made more strenuous efforts than before to
scale the walls, and in doing so met with little resistance
when the defenders saw the Turks on their rear.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></p>

<p>The church of St. Theodosia&mdash;now known as Gul Jami, or
the Mosque of the Bose, still a prominent building a short distance
to the west of the present inner bridge&mdash;was crowded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>with worshippers who had passed the night in prayers to the
Saint for the safety of the city. The 29th of May was her
feast, and a procession of worshippers was met and attacked
by a band of Turks, who had made their way to the
Plateia, probably the present Vefa. Those who took part
in the procession, mostly women, were apparently among
the first victims after the capture of the city.</p>

<p>The Greek and Italian ships had for some time, with the
aid of the defenders, prevented the men from the Turkish
vessels from scaling the walls. When, however, the
Turkish sailors succeeded in making their entry into the
city, the Christian ships began to take measures for their
own safety. The neighbouring gates had been thrown open,
and the Turkish sailors joined their countrymen in the
plunder and slaughter. Their ships both in the Horn and
on the side of the Marmora were, according to Barbaro,
absolutely deserted by their crews in their eagerness after
<span class="sidenote">General panic throughout city.</span>
loot. The defenders fled to their homes, and Ducas regretfully
observes that in so doing some were captured; others
found neither wife, child, nor possessions, but were themselves
made prisoners and marched off. The old men and
women who could not walk with the other captives were
killed and their babes thrown into the streets. From the
moment it was known that the Turkish troops had entered
there was a general and well-founded panic. The Moscovite
says that there was fighting in the streets, that the people
threw down upon the invaders tiles and any available
missiles, and that the opposition was so severe that the
pashas became afraid and persuaded the sultan to issue an
amnesty. But the story is improbable. There were few
men within the city capable of fighting except those who
had been at the walls. When there became a ‘Sauve qui
peut!’ these men hastened, as Ducas reports, to their homes.
That many of the fugitives, even old men and women,
knowing the fate before them and their children, may have
fought in desperation, willing to die rather than be captured
by an enemy who spared neither men in his cruelty nor
women in his lust, is likely enough, but that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
anything like an organised resistance in the streets is incredible.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">General
slaughter
during half
the day.</div>

<p>The Turks seem, indeed, to have anticipated greater
resistance than they met with. They could not believe that
the city was without more defenders than those who had
been at the walls. This, indeed, is their sole excuse for
beginning what several writers describe as a general
slaughter. From the entry of the army and camp-followers
until midday this slaughter went on. The Turks, says
Critobulus,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> had been taunted by the besieged with their
powerlessness to capture the city and were enraged at the
sufferings they had undergone. During the forenoon all
whom they encountered were put to the sword, women and
men, old and young, of every condition.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> The Turks slew
all throughout the city whom they met in their first
onslaught.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></p>

<p>The statements made by the spectators of such scenes
as they themselves witnessed are apt to be exaggerations,
but a Turkish massacre without elements of the grossest
brutality has never taken place. The declaration of
Phrantzes that in some places the earth could no longer be
seen on account of the multitude of dead bodies is sufficiently
rhetorical to convey its own corrective.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> So, too, is the
account by Barbaro of the numbers of heads of dead Christians
and Turks in the Golden Horn and the Marmora being
so great as to remind him of melons floating in his own
Venetian canals, and of the waters being coloured with blood.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">470</a>
That many nuns and other women preferred to throw themselves
into the wells rather than fall into the hands of the
Turks may be true. Their glorious successors in the Greek
War of Independence, and many Armenian women during
the massacres in 1895–6, chose a similar fate in preference to
surrendering to Turkish captors.</p>

<p>Probably the truth is that an indiscriminate slaughter
went on only till midday. For the love of slaughter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>tempered by the desire for gain. The young of both sexes,
and especially the strong and beautiful, could be held as
slaves or sold or ransomed. The statement of Leonard is
therefore probably correct, that all who resisted were killed,
that the Turks slew the weak, the decrepit and sick persons
generally, but that they spared the lives of others who
surrendered.</p>

<p>The Turkish historian Sad-ud-din says, ‘Having received
permission to loot, they thronged into the city with
joyous heart, and there, seizing their possessions and
families, they made the wretched misbelievers weep. They
acted in accordance with the precept, “Slaughter their aged
and capture their youth.”’<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<p>The brave Cretan sailors, who were defending the walls
near the Horaia Gate, took refuge in certain towers named
Basil, Leo, and Alexis. They could not be captured, and
would not surrender. In the afternoon, however, their
stubborn resistance being reported to the sultan, he consented
to allow them to leave the city with all their belongings, an
offer which they reluctantly accepted.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> The Cretans seem
to have been the last Christians who quitted their posts as
defenders of the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flight
towards
ships.</div>

<p>The panic caused by the morning’s massacre was
general. Men, women, and children sought to get outside
the city, to escape into the neighbouring country, or to reach
the ships in the harbour. Some were struck down on their
way; others were drowned before they could get on board.
The foreigners naturally made for their own ships. Some
of them have placed on record the manner of their escape.
Tetaldi says that ‘the great galleys of Romania remained<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>
till midday trying to save what Christians they could, and
receiving four hundred on board,’ among whom was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>named Tetaldi, who had been on guard very far from the
place where the Turks entered.’ He stripped himself and
swam to one of these vessels, where he was taken on board.
Barbaro relates that when the cry was raised that the Turks
had entered the city everybody took to flight and ran to the
sea in order to seek refuge in the Greek and foreign ships.</p>

<p>It was a pitiable sight, says Ducas, to see the shore outside
the walls all full of men and women, monks and nuns,
shouting to the ships and praying to be taken on board.
The ships took as many as they could, but the greater
number had to be left behind. The wretched inhabitants
expected no mercy, nor was any shown to them. Happily,
the Turks had now become keener after plunder than after
<span class="sidenote">Plunder organised.</span>
blood. When they found that there was no organised
force to resist them, they turned their attention solely
to loot. They set about the pillage of the city with
something like system. One body devoted its attention to
the wealthy mansions, dividing themselves for this purpose
into companies; another undertook the plunder of the
churches; a third robbed the smaller houses and shops.
These various bands overran the city, killing in case of
resistance, and taking as slaves men, women and children,
priests and laymen, regardless of age or condition. No
tragedy, says Critobulus, could equal it in horror. Women,
young and well educated; beautiful maidens of noble family,
who had never been exposed to the eye of man, were torn
from their chaste chambers with brutal violence and publicly
treated in horrible fashion. Virgins consecrated to God
were dragged by their hair from the churches and were
ruthlessly stripped of every ornament they possessed. A horde
of savage brutes committed unnameable atrocities, and hell
was let loose.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></p>

<p>The conquering horde had spread themselves all over the
city. For, while the regular troops had probably been kept
in hand on the chance of resistance, there were others who
could not be restrained from going in search of loot. Some
even among the first who had entered by the Kerkoporta had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>rushed to plunder the famous monastery of the Virgin, the
small chapel of which, known as the Kahriè mosque, still
attests by its exquisite mosaics the wealth and artistic
appreciation of its former occupants. The famous picture
attributed to St. Luke was cut into strips. Others among
them rushed off towards the many churches in Petra.
These were, however, only a small number. It was in the
afternoon of the day when the horde had entered across the
broken walls and through the gates that they swept like a
torrent over the city. Soon the organised bands, which had
divided the city among them in order to capture the population
and to seize all the gold and silver ornaments which
they could lay hands on, began to amass their treasures.
Old men and women, children, young men and maidens were
tied together in order to mark to whom they belonged.</p>

<p>The loot from private houses and churches was put
on one side for subsequent division and the partition was
made with considerable method. Small flags were hoisted
to indicate to other companies the houses plundered, and
everywhere throughout the city these signals were waving,
sometimes a single house having as many as ten.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Sophia
crowded
with
refugees.</div>

<p>A body of troops more amenable to discipline than we
may suppose the Bashi-bazouks to have been hastened across
the city towards Saint Sophia. Many inhabitants took
refuge in the churches, some probably with the idea that
the Turks would recognise that the sacred buildings should
afford sanctuary; others in the hope or possible belief of
some kind of miraculous interference on their behalf. Ducas
relates that a crowd of affrighted citizens ran to the great
church of Holy Wisdom because they believed in a prophecy
that the Turks would be allowed to enter the city and
slaughter the Romans until they reached the column of
Constantine&mdash;the present Burnt Column&mdash;but that then an
angel would descend from heaven with a sword and place it
and the government of the city in the hands of one whom
he would select, calling upon him to avenge the people of
the Lord, and that thereupon the Turks would be driven from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>the West. It was on this account, he declares, that the
Great Church was, within an hour from the tidings of the
entry of the Turks becoming known, filled with a great crowd
who believed themselves to be safe. By so doing they
had only rendered their capture more easy.</p>

<p>The first detachment of Turks who arrived and found
the doors closed soon succeeded in breaking in. The
great crowd were taken as in a drag-net, says Critobulus.
The miserable refugees thus made prisoners were tied or
chained together and any resistance offered was at once
overcome. Some were taken to the Turkish ships, others to
the camp, and the loot collected was dealt with in the same
manner. The scene was terrible, but, unhappily, one which
was destined to be reproduced with many even worse features
in Turkish history, because, while the chief object of the
Turkish hordes in 1453 was mainly to capture slaves and
other plunder, the attacks on many congregations in later
years, down to the time of the holocaust of Armenians at
Ourfa on December 28 and 29, 1895, were mainly for the
sake of slaughter. In the Great Church itself the Turks
struggled with each other for the possession of the most
beautiful women. Damsels who had been brought up
in luxury among the remnants of Byzantine nobility, nuns
who had been shut off from the world, became the subjects
of violence among their captors. Their garments were torn
from them by men who would not relinquish their prizes to
others. Masters and mistresses were tied to their servants;
dignitaries of the Church with the lowest menials. The
captors drove their flocks of victims before them in order to
lodge them in safety under charge of their comrades and to
return as quickly as possible to take a new batch. Ropes,
ribbons, handkerchiefs were requisitioned to bind them. The
sacred eikons were torn down and burnt, the altar cloths, chandeliers,
chalices, carpets, ornaments&mdash;indeed everything that
was valuable and portable&mdash;were carried off. The greatest
misfortune of all, says Phrantzes, was to see the Temple
of the Holy Wisdom, the Earthly Heaven, the Throne of
the Glory of God, defiled by these miscreants. One would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
hope that his story of its defilement and of the scenes of
open profligacy is exaggerated.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> The other churches were
plundered in like manner. They furnished a plentiful harvest.
The richly embroidered robes, chasubles woven with gold
and ornamented with pearls and precious stones, and church
furniture, were greedily seized, the ornaments being torn from
many of the objects and the rest thrown aside. A crucifix
was carried in mock solemnity in procession surmounted
by a Janissary’s cap.</p>

<p>While we can understand the indignation of the devout
believers at the contemptuous destruction of sacred relics
for the sake of the caskets in which they were contained,
we can hardly regret the disappearance of the so-called sacred
<span class="sidenote">Wanton destruction of books.</span>
objects themselves. But it is otherwise with the destruction
of books. The professors of Islam, whatever may have been
their conduct in regard to particular libraries, have usually
held the all-sufficiency of the Koran. That which contradicts
its teaching ought to be destroyed; that which is in accordance
with it is superfluous. The libraries of the churches,
whatever Mahomet himself may have believed, were to the
ignorant fanatical masses which followed him anti-Islamic.
The only value of books was the amount for which
they could be sold. Critobulus says that not only the holy
and religious books, but also those treating of profane
sciences and of philosophy, were either thrown into the fire
or trampled irreverently under foot, but that the greater
part were sold&mdash;not for the sake of the price but in mockery&mdash;for
two or three pence or even farthings.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p>The ships of the Turkish fleet had among their cargo,
says Ducas, an innumerable quantity of books.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> In the booty
collected by the Turks they were so plentiful and cheap,
that for a nummus&mdash;probably worth sixpence&mdash;ten volumes
were sold containing the works of Plato and Aristotle, treatises
on theology and other sciences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>

<p>Christian and Moslem writers agree in stating that the sack
of the city continued, as Mahomet had promised, for three
days. Khodja Sad-ud-din, after affirming that the soldiers
of Islam ‘acted in accordance with the precept, “Slaughter
their aged and capture their youth,”’ adds, with the Oriental
imagery of Turkish historians: ‘For three days and nights
there was, with the imperial permission, a general sack, and
the victorious troops, through the richness of the spoil,
entwined the arm of possession round the neck of their
desires, and by binding the lustre of their hearts to the locks
of the damsels, beautiful as houris, and by the sight of the
sweetly smiling fair ones, they made the eye of their hopes
the participator in their good fortune.’<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a></p>

<p>It must, however, not be forgotten that although those
who took the principal part in the sack were Mahometans,
yet there were also no small numbers of Christian renegades.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a></p>

captured.</div>

<p>As to the number of persons captured or killed, the
estimates do not greatly differ.</p>

<p>Leonard states that sixty thousand captives were bound
together preparatory to their final distribution. In such circumstances
exaggeration is usual and almost unavoidable.
But Critobulus, writing some years afterwards, estimates that
the number of Greeks and Italians killed during the siege and
after the capture was four thousand, that five hundred of
the army and upwards of fifty thousand of the rest of the
population were reduced to slavery.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a></p>

<p>Such of the Genoese and Venetians as had succeeded in
escaping from the city were preparing to get away to sea
with all haste. Happily the Turkish ships had been deserted
by their crews, who were busy looking after their share of
plunder on shore.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> In their absence a large number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>combatants, mostly foreigners, contrived to take refuge either
on board some of the various ships in the harbour or in
Galata. The Venetian Diedo, who had been appointed
captain of the harbour, when he saw that the city was taken,
went over to the podestà of Galata, says Barbaro, to consult
whether he should get his ships away or give battle. The
advice of the podestà was that he should remain until he
received an answer from Mahomet by which they would
learn whether the conqueror wanted war or peace with
Venice and Genoa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Panic
among
foreigners.</div>

<p>Meantime, the gates of Galata were closed, much to the
disgust of Barbaro himself, who was one of the Venetians
thus locked in.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> When, however, the Genoese saw that the
galleys were preparing to make sail, Diedo and his men were
allowed to leave. They went on board the captain’s galley
and pulled out to the boom, which had not yet been opened.
Two strong sailors leapt upon it with their axes and cut or
broke the chain in two.</p>

<p>The boom was apparently very strong, for, according to
Barbaro, the Turkish captains and crews, when they went
ashore to plunder, believed that the Christian vessels within
the harbour could not escape, because they would not be
able to pass through it.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> The ships passed outside and went
to the Double Columns, where the Turkish fleet had been
anchored, but which was now deserted. There they waited
until noon to see whether the Venetian merchant vessels
would join them. They had, however, been captured
by the Turks.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> Diedo, on learning this, left with his
galleys. Other Venetians hastened to follow. Some of the
vessels had lost a great part of their crews, and one regrets
to read that the brave Trevisano was left a prisoner in the
hands of the Turks. Happily for those who had reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>the ships, there was a strong north wind blowing; for, says
Barbaro, ‘if there had been a head wind we should have all
been made prisoners.’ Seven Genoese galleys also got outside
the boom and escaped.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> The remaining fifteen ships,
which belonged to Genoa, and four galleys of the emperor,
were taken by the Turks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Galata.</div>

<p>The alarm had spread to Galata, and many of its
inhabitants crowded to the shore, praying to be taken on
board the Genoese ships. They were ready to barter all they
possessed for a passage. Some were captured on their way
to the ships: among them, mothers who had deserted their
children, children who had been left behind by their parents.
Household goods, and even jewels, were abandoned in the
mad haste to escape from the terror. The number of
fugitives was far in excess of the carrying capacity of the
vessels which were hastily preparing to put to sea.</p>

<p>Mahomet, according to Ducas, knew of the preparations
and flight of many, and ground his teeth with rage because
he could do nothing to prevent their escape. Zagan Pasha,
to whom the Genoese, when they saw that Constantinople
was captured, opened the gates of Galata,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> seeing the
struggling crowd of men, women, and children attempting to
get away, and probably fearing that their flight would bring
war not only with Genoa but with other Western powers,
went among the fugitives and begged them to remain. He
swore by the head of the Prophet that they were safe, that
Galata would not be attacked, and that they had nothing to
fear, since they had been friendly to Mahomet. If they
went away, he declared the sultan would be dangerous in his
anger; whereas if they remained their capitulations would be
renewed on even more favourable conditions than they had
received from the emperors.</p>

<p>In spite of these promises, as many left the city as could.
They were hardly in time, because Hamoud, the Turkish
admiral, had by this time got his sailors in hand again and,
the boom being already opened, entered the harbour and
destroyed the Greek ships which remained.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span></p>

<p>The podestà and his council went to Mahomet and presented
him with the keys of Galata. He received them
graciously and gave them specious promises. The report of
the podestà himself, written less than a month after the
capture of the city, confirms in its essential features the
accounts given by Ducas, Leonard, and others of the panic
which seized the population under his rule. The Turks,
he says, captured many of the burgesses who had been sent
to fight at the stockade. A few managed to escape across
the water and returned to their families, while others got on
board the ships and left the country. He himself was
disposed to sacrifice his life rather than abandon his charge.
If he also had left, Galata would have been sacked, and he
remained to secure its safety. ‘I therefore sent ambassadors
to my lord Mahomet, making submission and asking for the
conditions of peace.’ No answer was sent on the first day
to this request, during which the ships were getting away
as fast as possible. The podestà begged their captains for
the love of God and their kindred to remain at least another
day, as he felt confident that he would be able to make peace.
They, however, refused, and sailed during the night. The
statement regarding the sultan’s anger was confirmed, for
the podestà relates that Mahomet told his ambassadors,
when he learned the news of the general flight, that he
wanted to be rid of them all. Thereupon the podestà
himself went to Mahomet, who either on the same day or
shortly afterwards came into Galata and insisted that the
fortifications should be so changed that the city would be at
his mercy. The walls on the sea front were to be in great
part destroyed: so also was the Tower of Galata&mdash;called
sometimes the Tower of the Holy Cross&mdash;to which one end
of the boom had been attached, and other strong portions of
the defences.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> All the cannon were taken away from Galata
and the arms and ammunition belonging to the burgesses
who had fled. Mahomet promised that these should be
returned to those who came back. Accordingly, the podestà
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>sent word to Chios to the merchants and other refugees
that if they returned they would receive their property.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a>
Mahomet, as a pledge of his sincerity and as the best means
of convincing the Genoese of his desire to be at peace with
them, granted ‘capitulations’ by which they were to retain
most of the customs and privileges which they had previously
obtained from the empire. They were to retain
the fortress of Galata and their own laws and government;
to elect their own podestà; to have freedom of trade
throughout the empire, and keep their own churches and
accustomed worship&mdash;but subject to the prohibition of bells&mdash;and
their private property and churches were to be respected.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet’s
entry into
Constantinople.</div>

<p>The massacre had been limited to the first day. The
permission to pillage had been granted for three days. On
the afternoon of the day of the capture, or possibly on the
following day, Mahomet made his triumphal entry into the
city. He was surrounded by his viziers and pashas and
by a detachment of Janissaries. He came into the city
through the gate now called Top Capou, rode on horseback
to the Great Church, descended and entered. As he passed
up the church he observed a Turk who was forcing out a
morsel of marble from the pavement, and asked why he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>thus damaging the building. The Turk pleaded that it was
only a building of the infidels and that he was a believer.
Mahomet had a sufficiently high opinion of the value of
St. Sophia to be angry with him. He drew his sword and
struck the man, telling him at the same time that, while he
had given the prisoners and the plunder of the city to his
followers, he had reserved the buildings for himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hagia
Sophia

<p>Mahomet called for an imaum, who by his orders
ascended the pulpit and made the declaration of Mahometan
faith. From that time to the present, the Temple of the

mosque.</p>

<p>On the same day<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> Mahomet entered the Imperial Palace,
and it is said that as he passed through the deserted rooms
in all the desolation resulting from the plunder of a barbarous
army, he quoted a Persian couplet on the vicissitudes
of mortal greatness: ‘The spider has become watchman in
the imperial palace, and has woven a curtain before the
doorway; the owl makes the royal tombs of Efrasaib
re-echo with its mournful song.’<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> The statement rests on
the authority of Cantemir, and, whether historically correct
or not, such a reflection under the circumstances is not in

sovereign.</p>

<p>The fate of the men of most eminence among the defenders

The bailey of the Venetians, with his son and seven of his
countrymen, was beheaded. Among them was Contarino,
the most distinguished among the Venetian nobles, who had
already been ransomed and who in breach of faith was
killed because his friends were unable to find the enormous
sum of seven thousand gold pieces for his second ransom.
The consul of Spain or the Catalans, with five or six of his
companions, met with the same fate.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> Cardinal Isidore in

<div class="sidenote">Phrantzes.</div>

<p>Phrantzes, the friend of the emperor and the historian
of his reign, had an even less happy experience. He suffered
the hard lot of slavery during a period of fifteen months.
His wife and children were captured and sold to the Master
of the Sultan’s Horse, who had bought many other ladies
belonging to the Greek nobility. A year later he was able
to redeem his wife. But the sultan hearing of the beauty
of his daughter Thamar took her into his seraglio. She
was then but fourteen years old, and died in 1454, shortly
after her captivity.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> In December of 1453 his son John,

<div class="sidenote">Notaras.</div>

<p>Most unhappy of all was the Grand Duke Notaras. He
was the most illustrious prisoner, and was indeed next in rank
to the emperor himself. He may be taken as a type of the
old Byzantine nobility. We have seen that he had been
the leader of the party which had resisted union with Rome.
On account of this opposition Notaras had incurred the
hostility of those who had accepted it, and as our sources of
information come almost exclusively from men of the
Roman faith or from those who had accepted the Union, he is
not usually spoken of with favour. Phrantzes was his rival
and enemy. Ducas gives two reports regarding his treatment
by Mahomet. According to one, he was betrayed by a captive
who purchased his own liberty by the betrayal of the Grand
Duke and Orchan. At first the illustrious captive was looked
upon favourably by the sultan, who condoled with him and
ordered a search for his wife and daughters. When they were
found, the sultan made them presents and sent them to their
house, declaring to the Grand Duke that it was his intention to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>make him governor of the city and allow him the same rank
that he had held under the emperor. This version is confirmed
by Critobulus,<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> who adds that Mahomet was dissuaded from
appointing him governor of the city by the remonstrances
of the leading Turks, who represented that it would be
dangerous. According to the other report, Mahomet charged
him with not having surrendered the city. Notaras is
represented as replying that it was neither in his power
nor in that of the emperor to do so, and to have made some
remark which increased the suspicion and hatred which the
sultan felt for his grand vizier, Halil Pasha. Whichever of
these reports is correct, no hesitation is expressed by Ducas
as to what followed. On the day following the interview, the
sultan, after a drinking bout, sent for the youngest of the
sons of the Grand Duke. Notaras replied that the Christian
religion forbade a father to comply with such a request.
When the answer was reported, Mahomet ordered the eunuch
to return, to take the executioner with him, and to bring the
youngest son together with the Grand Duke and his other
son. The order was obeyed and was followed by another to
put all three to death. The father asked the headsman to
allow the execution of his sons to precede his own. His reason
for this request, says Critobulus, was, lest his lads, being
perhaps afraid to die, might be tempted to save their lives by
renouncing their faith. Drawing himself up to his full height,
firmly and unflinchingly, with the stateliness of an ancient
aristocrat, the old noble witnessed the beheading of his two
sons without shedding a tear or moving a muscle. Then,
having given thanks to God that he had seen them die in the
faith of Christ, Notaras bent his head to the executioner’s
sword and died like a worthy representative of the proud
Roman nobility. ‘For this man,’ says the same writer, ‘was
pious and renowned for his knowledge of spiritual things,
for the loftiness of his soul and the nobility of his life.’<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></p>

<p>Including Notaras and his two sons, nine nobles of high
rank were put to death, all invincible in their faith. The
heads were taken by the executioner into the hall to show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>says Ducas, to the beast greedy of blood that his commands
had been obeyed.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">500</a></p>

<p>Phrantzes tells the story somewhat differently. He
begins his version by stating that the sultan, though elated
with the great victory, nevertheless showed himself to be
merciless. He makes the Grand Duke offer his wealth of
pearls, precious stones, and other valuables to Mahomet,
begging him to accept them and pretending that he had
kept them to offer to his captor. In reply to the sultan’s
question, Who had given to Notaras his wealth and to the
sultan the city? the captive answered that each was the
gift of God. To this the sultan retorted, ‘Then, why do you
pretend that you have kept your wealth for me? Why did
you not send it to me, so that I might have rewarded you?
Notaras was thrown into prison, but was sent for next day and
reproached for not having persuaded the emperor to accept
the conditions of peace which had been submitted. Thereupon,
the sultan gave the order that on the following day he
and his two sons should be put to death. They were taken
to the forum of the Xerolophon and the order was carried
out.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> Gibbon justly remarks that neither time nor death
nor his own retreat to a monastery could extort a feeling of
sympathy or forgiveness from Phrantzes towards his personal
enemy the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>The version given by Leonard is marked with the same
personal hostility towards Notaras which characterises that
of Phrantzes. Leonard accuses his old rival of having
thrown blame both on Halil Pasha, who had always been
friendly towards the emperor, and on the Genoese and
Venetians. In the account given by both these writers they
were reporting a version spread and probably believed by the
Unionist party, as to which it is improbable that they could
have had direct evidence. What is important in the narrative
of Leonard is that he confirms the ghastly story of
Ducas as to the demand for the youngest son by the sultan.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a>
The fate of the Grand Duke and his family was that which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>befell all the nobles and the chief officers of the empire.
Their wives and children were generally saved, Mahomet
himself taking possession for his own harem of the fairest
and distributing the rest among his followers.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Orchan.</div>

<p>The end of Orchan was attended by fewer circumstances
of ignominy. He had defended a part of the walls near
Seraglio Point. Orchan must always have anticipated death
if he were captured. It was believed that the sultan had
determined to kill him, as an elderly member of the reigning
house, in accordance with the custom that was common in
the governing family of the Turks, not only at the time
in question but for at least three centuries later. Orchan, who
was either the son or the grandson of Suliman the brother of
Mahomet the First, had fled for safety to the emperor, who had
refused to give him up and had treated him with kindness.
When it was no longer possible to hold the towers which
had been placed under his charge, he and the rest of their
defenders surrendered. Among them was a monk, with
whom Orchan changed clothes. He joined the Grand Duke,
and the two lowered themselves outside the walls, but were
caught by the Turks and taken on shipboard. Unfortunately,
the rest of the defenders of the towers, who had been
taken prisoners, were brought on board the same Turkish
ship. A Greek offered to reveal Orchan and the Grand Duke
if he were promised his liberty, and, having received the
assurance, pointed to the man dressed as a monk and to
Notaras. Orchan was at once beheaded and his head taken
to Mahomet.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a></p>

<p>The city was made a desolation. The followers of
Mahomet, soldiers and sailors, left nothing of value except
the buildings. Constantinople, says Critobulus, was as if it
had been visited by a hurricane or had been burnt. It was
as silent as a tomb. The sailors especially were active in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>destruction. The churches, crypts, coffins, cellars, every
place and every thing was ransacked or broken into in
search of plunder.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> Mahomet, according to the same writer,
wept as he saw the ravages his soldiers had wrought, and
expressed his amazement at the ruins of the city which had
been given over to plunder and had been made a desert.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></p>

<p>All the Turks who first entered the city became rich,
says the Superior of the Franciscans.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> Captives were sent in
great numbers to Asia Minor either for sale or to the homes
of the armed population who had taken part in the siege.
Only a miserable remnant remained in Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affection
of Constantinopolitans
for their
city.</div>

<p>The reader of the accounts of the siege, and indeed of its
history generally before 1453, cannot but be struck with
the attachment shown by its inhabitants towards their city.
For them it is the Queen of Cities, the most beautiful, the
most wealthy, the most orderly, and the most civilised in the
world. There the merchant could find all the produce of
the East, and could trade with buyers from all countries.
There the student had access to the great libraries of
philosophy, law, and theology, the rich storehouse of the
writings of the Christian Fathers, and of the great classics of
ancient Greece. In quietness and security, generations of
monks had copied the manuscripts of earlier days free from
the alarms which in Western and Eastern countries alike
disturbed the scholar. The Church, the lawyers and
scholars had kept alive a knowledge of the ancient language
in a form in all its essential features like that which existed
in the days of Pericles. Priests and laymen were proud to
be inheritors and guardians of the writings of classical times
and to consider themselves of the same blood as their
authors. Though often almost as intolerant towards
heretics as the great sister Church of the West, they did not
and could not regard Aristotle and Plato, Leonidas and Pericles,
and the rest of their glorious predecessors as eternally
lost because they had not known Christ, and their sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>relationship with them helped to develop a conviction of the
continuity of their history, not only with Constantine and the
Roman empire, but with the more remote peoples who had
given them their language. The New Rome had for a
thousand years been towards all Eastern Christians all that
the Elder Rome was to those in the West, and their pride
in its stability and security was great. Once, and once
alone, had it been captured. But the unfortunate attack
made by the West in 1204, the results of which had
been so correctly foreseen and foretold by Innocent the
Third, had been in part overcome. This new capture was
infinitely more serious. The essential difference between
the two is commented on by Critobulus. By the first the
city sustained a foreign domination for sixty years and lost
much of its wealth. A great number of beautiful statues
and other works of art, coveted by the whole world, were
taken away and many more destroyed. But there the
mischief stopped. The city did not lose all its inhabitants.
Wives and children were not taken away. When the
tyranny was past, the city recovered and once more it
figured as the renowned capital of an empire, though only a
simulacrum of what it had once been. It was still in the
eyes of all Greek-speaking people the leader and example of
all that was good, the home of philosophy and of every kind
of learning, of science, of virtue, and in truth of all that is
best.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> Now, all was changed: the new conquerors were
Asiatics. A false religion replaced Christianity. The
capital was a desert.</p>

<p>The city’s situation of picturesque beauty, as well as its
Christian and historical associations, increased the love for it
of its inhabitants and made them as proud of Constantinople
as ever were the Italian citizens of Florence or Venice. It
is therefore not surprising to find that, on its conquest, the
grief and the rage of those who had lived in it are almost
too great for words. She, says Critobulus, who had
formerly reigned over many people with honour, glory,
and renown, is now ruled by others and has sunk into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>poverty, ignominy, dishonour, and shameful slavery. The
lamentations of Ducas are as sincere as those of
Jeremiah. Its inhabitants gone; its womanhood destined
to dishonourable servitude; its nobles massacred; the very
babes at the breast butchered; the temples of God defiled:
all present a spectacle on which he enlarges with the
expression of a hope that the anger of God will be appeased
and that His people will yet find favour. Unhappily, the
Greek race had entered upon the darkness of the blackest
night, and nearly four centuries had to pass before the dawn
of their new day was at hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet’s
attempts
to repeople
the capital.</div>

<p>At a later date Mahomet himself recognised that it was
necessary to do something towards the repeopling of Constantinople.
He gave orders that five thousand families should
be sent from the provinces to the capital, and commanded the
repair of the walls.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> It does not appear, however, that they
were repaired in an efficient manner. It is generally easy
to distinguish between Turkish repairs and those effected at
an earlier date. Critobulus states that Mahomet ordered
the renewal of those parts which had been overthrown by
the cannon and of both the sea and the landward walls,
which had suffered by time and weather.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> The sea walls
were probably thoroughly repaired; of those on the landward
side probably only the Inner Wall. Experience had
shown that more than one strong wall was a disadvantage
rather than otherwise. Ducas states that the five thousand
families sent to Constantinople by Mahomet from Trebizond,
Sinope, and Asprocastron under pain of death included
masons and lime-burners for repairing the walls.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">511</a></p>

may be, as Critobulus asserts, that he felt a genuine pity for
the sufferings of the captives. As a young man, with, for a
Turk, quite exceptional knowledge of the literary possessions
of the old world, it is easy to believe that he was desirous
of satisfying the Christians, while his general intelligence
must have convinced him that trade and commerce, from
which a revenue was to be derived, would be much more
likely to flourish with them than with men of his own race.
Critobulus insists that his first intention was to employ
Notaras and others of the leading Greeks in the public
service, and that he recognised when it was too late that he
had been misled into the blunder of putting them to death,
and sent away from his court some of those who had
counselled their executions, and even condemned some others
to death.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> A few days after the conquest, he ordered the
captives who formed part of his own share in the booty to
be established in houses on the slope towards the Golden
Horn. From among the noble families he selected the
young men for himself. Some of these he placed in the
corps of Janissaries; others, who were distinguished by
their education, he kept near him as pages.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">513</a></p>

<p>It was during these days that Critobulus the historian
sent envoys to the city, who took with them the submission
of the islands of Imbros, where he was living, of Lemnos and
Thasos. The archons had learned of the capture of the city.
Most of them fled, fearing that admiral Hamoud, who
had returned with the fleet to Gallipoli, would attack the
inhabitants of the islands and treat them as he had done
those of Prinkipo. Critobulus, however, sent a large
bakshish to Hamoud and arranged that if the inhabitants
submitted there should be no attack. Thereupon Critobulus
had sent the envoys to Constantinople, with rich presents
for the sultan, to make submission. The islanders were
ordered to pay the same taxes to the sultan as they
had formerly paid to the emperor, and thus, says the historian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>were preserved from the great danger which threatened
them.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">514</a></p>

<p>Mahomet published an edict within a few weeks of the
capture of the city, that all of the former inhabitants who
had paid ransom, or who were ready to enter into an agreement
with their masters to pay it within a fixed period,
should be considered free, be allowed to live in the city,
and should for a time be exempt from taxes. Phrantzes
states<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> that even on the third day after the capture an
order was issued allowing those to return who had fled
from the city and who were in hiding, promising that they
should not be molested. Upon the question whether on
such return they would, as Critobulus relates, have to pay
ransom Phrantzes is silent. A few weeks later, after
his visit to Adrianople, Mahomet sent orders to various
parts of his empire to despatch families of Christians,
Jews, and Turks to repeople the city. He endeavoured to
allure Greeks and other workmen by employing them on
public works, notably in the construction of a palace&mdash;for
which, Critobulus rightly says, he had chosen the most
beautiful site in the city, namely, at Seraglio Point&mdash;on the
construction of the fortress of the Seven Towers around the
Golden Gate, and at the repairs of the Inner Wall. He
ordered the Turks to allow their slaves to take part in this
work, so that they might earn money not only to live but to
save enough for their ransom.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">516</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Toleration
of Christianity
decreed.</div>

<p>Mahomet’s most important step towards conciliation was
to decree the toleration of Christian worship and to allow
the Church to retain its organisation. As George Scholarius
had been the favourite of the Greeks who had refused to
accept the Union with Rome, Mahomet ordered search for
him. After much difficulty, he was found at Adrianople, a
slave in the house of a pasha, kept under confinement as a
prisoner, but treated with distinction. His master had
recognised, or had learned, that his captive was a man of
exceptional talent. He was sent to the sultan, who was
already well disposed towards him on account of his renown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>in philosophy. Scholarius made a favourable impression in
the interview by his intelligence and manners. Mahomet
ordered that he should have access to the palace when he
wished, begged him always to speak freely in their intercourse,
and sent him away with valuable presents.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></p>

<p>A Record of the ecclesiastical affairs of the Orthodox
Church, written within ten years after the capture, states
that Mahomet, desiring to increase the number of the inhabitants
of Constantinople, gave to the Christians permission
to follow the customs of their Churches, and, having learned
that they had no patriarch, ordered them to choose whom
they would. He promised to accept their choice and that
the patriarch should enjoy very nearly the same privileges
as his predecessors. A local synod having been called,
George Scholarius was elected, and became known as Gennadius.
The sultan received him at his seraglio, and with his
own hands presented him with a valuable pastoral cross of
silver and gold, saying to him, ‘Be patriarch and be at
peace. Count upon our friendship as long as thou desirest it,
and thou shalt enjoy all the privileges of thy predecessors.’</p>

<p>After the interview the sultan caused him to be mounted
upon a richly caparisoned horse and conducted to the Church
of the Holy Apostles, which he presented to him as the
church of the patriarchate as it had formerly been.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">518</a></p>

<p>After the election of Gennadius, the sultan, according to
Critobulus, continued his intercourse with the new patriarch
and discussed with him questions relating to Christianity,
urging him to speak his mind freely. Mahomet even paid
him visits and took with him the most learned men whom
he had persuaded to be present at his court.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">519</a></p>

attempts
to repeople
capital.</div>

<p>During the long reign of Mahomet his attention was
again and again directed to the repeopling of his capital,
In addition to the attempts already mentioned, Critobulus
recounts many other efforts made with the same object.
But the sultan’s inducements mostly failed. The Christians
mistrusted his promises, and experience showed
that they were justified in so doing. Mahomet addressed
himself to the Greek noble families and endeavoured
to persuade them to return to the city. He publicly
promised that all who came back and could prove their
nobility and descent should be treated with even more
distinction than had been shown to them under the emperor
and should continue to enjoy the same rank as before.
Relying on this promise, a number of them returned, on
the feast of St. Peter. They, however, paid dearly for their
credulity. Either the promise which had been given was
of the hasty, spasmodic kind which has often characterised
the orders of most of the Ottoman sultans and was repented
of, or it had been given treacherously with no idea of
its being kept. The heads of the nobles soon sullied
the steps of Mahomet’s court.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> The repeopling which
could not be done by persuasion was attempted more
successfully by force.</p>

<p>In 1458, while Mahomet was attacking Corinth his army
made a raid in the neighbouring country and brought in
more than three thousand prisoners, men, women and
children. These were sent to settle outside the walls of
Constantinople, on the lands which had been devastated
before the siege. In the following year the sultan returned
from the Peloponnesus. The artisans whom he had captured
were settled in the capital; the remainder in the neighbourhood.
In the same year he ordered that the most well-to-do
inhabitants of Amastris on the Black Sea, including all the
Armenian merchants, should be sent to the capital. It was
partly to employ the workmen thus brought together that
he ordered the construction of the mosque which bears his
name.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span></p>
<p>In 1460 he published an Iradè inviting all who had ever
lived in the capital to return. There were many fugitives,
says Critobulus, at Adrianople, Philippopolis, Brousa, and
elsewhere, who had been sold as slaves or had left the city
before the siege: learned, noble, and industrious men who
by their ability had already gained positions of comfort and
even of wealth. All these, therefore, he transported to the
capital, giving some of them honour, others permission to
build where they liked, and to others again all that was needed
to establish themselves. He transported to the capital all
the inhabitants of the two Phocaeas. He sent his admiral
in chief with forty ships into the Archipelago for the same
purpose. The people of Thasos and of Samothracia were
carried <i>en masse</i> to the capital.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></p>

AS LEGISLATOR; HIS RECKLESSNESS OF
HUMAN LIFE; AS STUDENT; WAS HE A RELIGIOUS
FANATIC? SUMMARY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> capture of Constantinople sent an electric shock
throughout Europe. The great achievement of the young
sultan came as an almost incredible surprise. During the
whole subsequent course of his reign the greatest question
of interest in the West was, What progress is Mahomet
making? Menaces of what he intended to do, reports of
what he had done, occupied the attention of all. As with
the capture of the Queen City the Greek empire came to an
end, it is not my purpose to endeavour to tell the story of
his subsequent life and conquests. But as he figured so
largely on the European stage, and as his exploits and
administration firmly established the Turks in Europe, it is
desirable to indicate some of the principal events of his
reign and to sketch the leading features of his character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conquest
of Trebizond.</div>

<p>His successes as a soldier were many and important.
One of the first of his conquests was to put an end to the
empire of Trebizond. As its history and decay played an
unimportant part in the destruction of the Greek empire, it
has been unnecessary to give an account of this pretentiously
named State. It had occupied a narrow strip of land along
the southern shore of the Black Sea, of varying length, from
a point near Batoum towards the west, on one occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
stretching to within sight of the Bosporus, but never including
either Amassus or Sinope. Its population, though
Greek-speaking, was mostly composed of Lazes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary
of its
history.</div>

<p>When the Latin invaders were on the point of capturing
Constantinople, two young Greek princes had escaped to
Trebizond, defeated the Byzantine governor, and one of
them, named Alexis, was acclaimed emperor. He took the
title of Grand Comnenus and Emperor of the Faithful
Romans. It seemed for a short while as if he, instead of
Theodore Lascaris at Nicaea, might take the lead of the
Greek peoples, and indeed Theodore had to arrange with the
sultan of Konia&mdash;or, as he called himself, of Roum, that is, of
the Romans&mdash;to prevent Alexis from attempting to extend
his territory to Nicaea. But the power of the Trebizond
empire did not increase, although the city from which it took
its name became large, wealthy, and populous. Even before
1228 it had become tributary to the Seljuk sultan and so
continued till 1280. A series of more or less uninteresting
and incompetent emperors and empresses continued to hold
a semi-independent position, amid alternate intrigues and
struggles with Turkoman and Turkish tribes, and fierce
fights with the Genoese, until the advent of Timour. The
emperor of Trebizond, as in later years he called himself,
consented to become the vassal of this great leader, and
agreed to send twenty ships to join a like number which the
Greek emperor was to prepare at Constantinople to attack
Bajazed. The defeat of the Ilderim at Angora rendered
such joint action unnecessary. When Timour retired, Trebizond
languished until its territory was little more than a
small district around the capital. It was first attacked by the
Ottoman Turks in 1442, and made a successful defence. After
the capture of Constantinople, the emperor John consented to
become a tributary prince of Mahomet, but shortly afterwards
attempted to unite the emirs of Sinope and Caramania and
the Christian kings of Georgia and Lesser Armenia in a
league to attack his suzerain. Before anything could be
done, John died, and when Mahomet, in 1461, having subjugated
the Greeks in Morea, turned his attention to Trebizond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
no allies were ready to aid David, the new emperor. A
great expedition of sixty thousand cavalry and eighty
thousand infantry was led by Mahomet himself to David’s
capital, while a large fleet co-operated with the army. The
alternative was given of massacre or submission. The
emperor surrendered and Trebizond became part of the
Ottoman empire. A large party of the population was
subsequently sent to repeople Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet
as conqueror.</div>

<p>Mahomet’s biographers claim that he conquered two
empires and seven kingdoms: those of Serbia, Bosnia,
Albania, Moldavia, Morea, Caramania, and Kastemouni.
The two empires may be admitted; the seven kingdoms can
only be said&mdash;even where they are entitled to take rank as
kingdoms&mdash;to have been conquered by Mahomet, with the
reserve that he reaped where his ancestors had sown. But
with this proviso the statement is sufficiently near the truth
to be accepted.</p>

<p>If his successes had been equal to his ambition or to his
designs he might fairly be classed with the world’s great
military leaders. He fought, however, with far less success
than Alexander, who was his great exemplar, and almost
always with the advantage of overwhelming numbers. His
progress was checked by the courage of John Hunyadi and
the Hungarians. Scanderbeg continued for twenty years,
with comparatively few followers and small resources, to
wage guerilla warfare against him, and the knights of St.
John triumphantly repelled his attacks upon Rhodes. Nor
was he able to defeat the power of Persia.</p>

of Painting’ (vol. i. p. 304).</p>

<p>Though the two portraits are surrounded with very similar and beautiful
arabesque arches and evidently are of the same person, that of Sir Henry Layard
differs from the one reproduced on the opposite page in showing a more receding
chin and a thinner beard than even the medallion. The name of Gentile Bellini
appears on both paintings.</p></div>

<hr />

<p>Mahomet’s wars were essentially those of conquest. He
required no pretext for making war. It was sufficient that
he wished to extend his own territory. His warlike nation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>during the first years after the conquest of the city was
always ready to aid in the execution of his designs against
other states. His energy and ambition allowed him little
time for rest and as the years went by wore out the strength
and even the patience of his followers. He kept his army&mdash;which
included almost every available man of the Turkish
race under his sway&mdash;occupied almost continually for nearly
twelve years after 1453, until at length, worn out with long
marches, weakened by constant labour, and having sacrificed
their goods, their horses, and their health for their master,
his soldiers, including the very Janissaries themselves, became
discontented and clamoured for rest. Critobulus, who
makes this statement, records that an expedition into Illyria
was reluctantly postponed because Mahomet was compelled
to recognise at last that rest was absolutely necessary for
troops who had not known it for years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He improves
Turkish
fleet.</div>

<p>From the moment of his conquest of the city he saw the
importance of keeping up a strong fleet. He maintained
and enlarged that which he had prepared for the blockade
of the city, and was at all times able, upon any sign of revolt,
to send a sufficient force by sea to maintain his rule. Indeed,
it may be said that once he had imposed his peace upon all
the districts round the Marmora and the Aegean, his fleet
enabled him to preserve it. With its aid, too, he succeeded
in exacting tribute from Egypt and Syria. Critobulus notes
that his master, having observed that the Venetians and
Genoese had gained their success in the Mediterranean by
means of large ships, constructed a number of new vessels
which were able to cope with them, and raised a sufficient
number of oarsmen to resist their attacks on the Turkish
coasts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet
as reformer
of
the administration.</div>

<p>Nor was Mahomet less active in improving the civil
organisation of his government. We have already seen that
before his conquest of the city, he commenced reforms in the
collection of the taxes. He dismissed incompetent pashas
and replaced them by others distinguished by their intelligence,
their honesty, and their military capacity, for it
must always be remembered that militarism was and is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
vital part of Turkish administration. Critobulus claims that
the aim he had most completely at heart was to secure the
best and the most just administration possible. The finances
of the country he found in the utmost disorder. One third
of the revenue was wasted, and this in a short time he made
available for his own purposes. He continued his reform
in the system of tax-collecting and, while thus increasing the
revenue, took care to strike terror into the farmers of the taxes
and all those whose duty it was to see that money entered
the public treasury and that it was not plundered when it got
there. Both in the government of the army and in the civil
administration Mahomet bestowed the utmost care upon
details, and trusted nothing to his subordinates until he had
seen every preparation made for a satisfactory control.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet
as law-giver.</div>

<p>The Turks speak of Mahomet as the Canouni or Lawgiver,
and the epithet is deserved. But while his edicts in
aid of better organisation and less corrupt administration
are deservedly praised by them, it is as the lawgiver that we
come upon one of the darkest sides of his character. Von
Hammer points out that the Turkish histories of many
centuries furnish examples of political fratricides, but that it
was reserved to the law of Mahomet the Second to legitimise
the slaughter of younger brothers by the Ottoman sultans.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">523</a>
His predecessors had practised the crime. Mahomet not
only followed their example but made the practice legal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His recklessness
of
human
life.</div>

<p>Connected with all his achievements there is the stain
of blood. Many contemporary writers speak of him as a
monster of cruelty. We may discredit the statement that
he caused Christians to be put to death while he feasted, as
insufficiently proved. But even Critobulus, who is usually
an apologist, has, as a faithful historian, to speak of his
cruel deeds. When Castrion surrendered, he killed every
man in the garrison and sent the women and children into
slavery. When Gardikion submitted, its defenders were treated
in a similar manner.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> Von Hammer dismisses as unfounded
the story of Mahomet having the bodies of fourteen pages
ripped open to find who had eaten a poor woman’s cucumbers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>and the singularly dramatic story of the slaughter of Irene
in order to demonstrate to his troops that though he loved
the most beautiful woman in the world he was yet master
of himself, justly remarking that the massacre of garrisons
faithful to their trust, the execution of the members of the
imperial family of Trebizond and of the king of Bosnia,
cry sufficiently aloud without need of exaggeration. Resistance
to his lusts or even to his lawful desires was punished
relentlessly by death.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> He executed his grand vizier
Mahmoud because of his independence. He tortured and
then put to death his old tutor and vizier Halil Pasha. He
sawed five hundred prisoners in halves whom he had captured
in Achaia. ‘He was more cruel than Nero, and delighted in
bloodshed,’ says Tetaldi. Probably it would be impossible
to find a contemporary writer who does not employ similar
language. Many of his acts are without the shadow of
excuse. They are the result of wild impulse which had
never been under control, and deserve to be classed as
wanton cruelties inflicted by a man who was reckless of
human suffering. There are others which may be put
down to what he probably regarded as the exigencies of his
position. If in his opinion the assassination of a brother,
the slaughter of a great number of his enemies in war, and
the murder of those of his subjects who opposed him
were necessary to the accomplishment of his objects, he never
hesitated. Like other great military rulers, Caesar yesterday,
Napoleon to-day, Mahomet regarded men as so many
counters, to be kept so long as they were useful in his game,
to be cast aside when no longer wanted. Belonging to a
family accustomed to absolute rule of the Eastern type, to a
race which has never valued life as against military success,
and having been reared amid dangers where his struggle
for power and even for life was almost daily, he swept away
every man who opposed him. His enemies would have
dealt hardly with him, and he never appeared to doubt that
he was justified in dealing hardly with or getting rid of them.
It was part of the game of war. <i>Vae victis!</i> And yet this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>man seems occasionally to have sympathised with the
suffering he had caused, and even to have exercised rigorous
justice. Critobulus, after recounting many cruel deeds, adds
that Mahomet showed special kindness towards prisoners of
war, and whenever in his rides through the city he encountered
them would stop his horse and give generously to all.
According to Cantemir and other Turkish historians, this
monster of cruelty and legaliser of fratricide bowstrung his
eldest son for having violated the wife of another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomet
as student.</div>

<p>It is a welcome change to turn from Mahomet the blood-drinker,
the lawgiver who first made the horrible practice
legal which was to shock Europe during nearly four
centuries, to Mahomet the student, the patron and
companion of scholars and artists, and the man who was
interested in questions of religion. He was a linguist and
knew, says Phrantzes,<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> five languages besides his own&mdash;Greek,
Latin, Arabic, Chaldean, and Persian. His favourite
study was history. The achievements of Alexander the
Great had filled the world from India westward with his
fame, had been the subject of romance, and had caused his
name to be regarded throughout the East as that of an
almost supernatural hero. Alexander figures constantly in
the lives of the Turkish sultans as a fascinating historical
figure. As late as 1621 a French writer notes that the then
reigning sultan while at dinner had the history of his predecessors
read over to him or the Life of Alexander the Great.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">527</a>
But upon none had the memory of the Macedonian made so
great an impression as upon Mahomet. Alexander was the
leader whose career was to be imitated and whose conquests
were to be rivalled. His contemporaries frequently compare
the two men. ‘It was,’ says Critobulus, ‘the Alexanders
and the Pompeys, Caesar and the like rulers, whom
Mahomet proposed to himself as models.’ ‘This young
Alexander,’ says Ducas, referring to the transport of part of
Mahomet’s fleet over land, ‘has surpassed the former one,
and has led his ships over the hills as over the waves.’ ‘He
wished,’ says Tetaldi, ‘to conquer the whole world, to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>more than Alexander and Caesar or any other valiant man
who has ever lived.’ Phrantzes describes him as a careful
reader of the Lives of Alexander, of Octavius Caesar, of the
Great Constantine, and of Theodosius.</p>

<p>Mahomet had continued from his boyhood to show his
interest in studies, not only by his own reading but by
welcoming other students, ‘for he was constantly striving
to acquire those arts by which he should excel his predecessors
and extend the bounds of his kingdom as far as
possible.’ ‘He gathered to himself virtuous and learned
men,’ says Phrantzes. He was, says Lonicerus,<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> an
admirer of intellect and of the arts. He caused learned
men and skilled artists to be brought to him at great
expense. He employed Bellini,<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> a Venetian, and other
artists, and loaded them with gifts. Virtue strove with vice
within him. He had read all the history, says Critobulus,
that was accessible to him in Arabic and Persian, and such
Greek literature as had been translated into either of these
languages, including Aristotle and the writings of the Stoics,
and was skilled in astrology and in mathematics. A few
years after he became sultan a certain George Ameroukes is
found attached to his suite, a man described by Critobulus<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">530</a>
as learned in philosophy, natural science, and mathematics.
Mahomet made much of him, and called him often to
discuss philosophical questions. Not a day passed without
interviews with him or with other learned men attached to
the court. In matters relating to foreign countries he was
especially curious. Having met with the geographical
writings of Ptolemy, he not only had them translated into
Arabic, but charged George to make a map of the world
with all the indications that he could give of the various
countries, rivers, lakes, mountains, cities, and distances; for,
says Critobulus, ‘the science of geography appeared to him
necessary and most useful.’<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> In the course of his expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>to reduce Mitylene and Lemnos he visited the ruins of Troy
and the traditional tombs of Achilles and Ajax and admired
the good fortune of the heroes who had a poet like
Homer to commemorate their deeds. ‘It is said,’ cautiously
remarks his biographer, ‘that he believed that God had
charged him to be the avenger of the ancient city.’<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> He
frequently called the patriarch, the learned Gennadius, and
discussed with him questions of theology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was
Mahomet
a religious
fanatic?</div>

<p>Mahomet cannot justly be represented as a religious
fanatic. He of course conformed to the practices of Islam,
built many mosques, and did nothing to show irreverence
for the teaching of the Prophet. He was possibly in his
youth a devout believer in the tenets of Islam. But it is
difficult to believe that a man who conversed freely with
Gennadius on the difference between Christianity and his
own religion, and who had paid as much attention as
he had paid to Greek and Arabian philosophy, should be
a fanatic. Mahomet’s most recent Turkish biographer
claims that he was tolerant and alleges as a reason for this
statement that he did not follow the example of the Arab
conquerors and put all to the sword who did not accept
Islam. The more fanatical Mahometans probably urged
him to take this course.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> The hope of plunder and the
value of captives as slaves probably furnished a more
effective argument against general extermination.</p>

<p>Moreover, Mahomet had need of an industrious population,
not only for the repeopling of the capital but to furnish
a revenue.</p>

<p>His subjects, even of both religions, regarded him as
a Gallio, or as a man of no religion.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> The statements
that in private he branded the Prophet as a robber and
impostor, or that he was half converted to Christianity
by Gennadius and that shortly before his death he became
a great worshipper of relics and burned candles before them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>may be dismissed as not supported by trustworthy evidence.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">535</a>
The sovereign’s readiness even to discuss Christianity and
speak with unbelievers upon questions of philosophy and
religion would be certain to obtain for him the reputation of
atheist from the ignorant among his own people; for to the
faithful Mahometan no other religions need be discussed:
they exist only for condemnation; to study them is to
express a doubt upon the all-sufficiency of the teaching of
the Koran, and a doubt on such a subject is treason to the
faith. But at least such accusations do not point towards
fanaticism. The man who by one party is claimed as
almost persuaded to be a Christian and is regarded by the
other as an atheist or at least a disloyal believer in Islam
can hardly have been a religious persecutor. It may be
true that after conversing with the patriarch or with any
other unbeliever he went through the prescribed forms of
washing, but if he wished to preserve the loyalty of his
subjects it was necessary for him to observe such formalities
of purification. He was at the head of the Turkish nation,
that is, of an armed camp, a nation in the field whose chief
if not sole bond of unity was, as it still remains, the belief in
the prophet-hood of the founder of Islam. Nearly all his
soldiers held the one great creed and went into battle with
shouts of ‘Allah!’ and ‘Mahomet!’ They believed, as the
followers of the Prophet have always fervently believed, that
death on the battle-field fighting for Islam is the shortest
road to Paradise and the Houris. The Turks were ready to
obey and endure unto death for the sake of the sovereign
whom Allah had placed at their head. Some of them
were as full of religious enthusiasm as crusaders, as
confident that they were working for God as Cromwell’s
Ironsides, and as fanatic as a grossly ignorant army can be
which believes itself to be immeasurably superior to the
enemy because, on the one hand, it possesses the true faith,
while, on the other, the enemy, more learned in the world’s
despicable science and philosophy falsely so called, is in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>abysmal darkness of unbelief. The support of such men
was not to be risked by any nonconformity with the rites
which are the outward signs of Islam. Mahomet would
have been of all rulers the most blind to his own interest if
he had derided their beliefs.</p>

<p>But though Mahomet was the leader of a nation
containing many fanatics, there is nothing to show that he
shared their fanaticism. If he appealed to it, it was because
it gave force to his army. He was no more inclined to be a
fanatic himself than was Napoleon to be a democrat when
he called upon his troops to fulfil their mission of carrying
democratic principles to England and other countries
assumed to be suffering under despotic rule. In a different
age and under different circumstances Mahomet might have
been a thoughtful student, or an excellent civil administrator,
but it is difficult to conceive that he could ever have been a
religious persecutor.</p>

<p>He remained all his life a student, desirous of learning,
but he was at the same time a man of energy, a successful
general, and a good administrator. He was without high
ideals of life, but capable of spasmodic kindness, a man not
given to sensual pleasures&mdash;in his later years at least&mdash;sober,
intolerant of drunkenness, seeking his pleasure in glory.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">536</a>
He appears to me essentially a lonely man; one who took
each man’s censure but reserved his judgment; one who, in
his own phrase, would pluck out a hair from his beard if he
believed that it knew his designs. He was too suspicious
and too highly placed to have friends. He was supremely
selfish and only considered himself bound to respect his
promise when it suited his purpose to do so. Circumstances
compelled him to be a soldier, and his great natural abilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>made him a successful one, but his ambition, which was
spasmodically great&mdash;which meditated the conquest of
Naples, an expedition against Rome, and other conquests, as
stages in his great design of conquering the world<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">537</a>&mdash;wanted
pertinacity and was joined to an emotional, almost a sentimental,
nature. He relieved his loneliness and friendlessness
by hard work, study, and the companionship of artists
and learned men.</p>

<p>Cantemir calls him the most glorious prince who ever
occupied the Ottoman throne, but adds that he did not
listen to the voice of conscience, and that he broke his word
without any hesitation when it seemed politic so to do.
Chalcondylas speaks of him as great in intellect, in conquest,
and in cruelty. Halil Ganem says, with truth, that by
his military exploits Mahomet occupies the first place in
the Ottoman annals. He impartially states also that he
shed abundance of blood to secure peaceful possession of
the throne, and for his pleasure. ‘To shed blood became
for this grand monarch a function which he exercised with
an incredible <i>maestria</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> His long series of victorious
conquests and especially his success in the capture of the
city have caused him to be known in Ottoman history as the
Fetieh or Conqueror.</p>

<p>In forming a judgment upon the character of a ruler
whose reign marks an epoch of importance in the world’s
history, it is needful to take account of his life and his acts
in their entirety: to ask what the man accomplished and
with what means; what were his ideals and how far he
realised them. We may recognise that Cromwell was a
great ruler notwithstanding Drogheda, and that William the
Third was a great statesman in spite of Glencoe, even
supposing that he fully approved of that massacre. Taking
a broad view of the character of Mahomet, we may
observe that his conquests were made by means of overwhelming
numbers, that his army from its composition
was the most mobile in existence, and that its greatest
success was but the final act in a series which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>gained by his predecessors. But while giving due importance
to these considerations, it yet remains true that his
reign marks an epoch, not only of Turkish history, where its
influence is the most conspicuous, but in that of Europe
generally. To him more than to any other ruler the organisation
of the Turks as a governing power is due. To him
must also be credited the creation of Turkey as a European
State. Subsequent sultans built on the foundations which
he had laid. It is also not too much to say that none of his
successors have done so much to give orderly government to
the Turkish race as Mahomet. But for the fact that the
influence of Moslemism strangles the moral and intellectual
growth of the Turkish people, the rule of a few more sultans
possessed of the like capacity and determination to secure
strong, orderly, and even just government might possibly
have placed Turkey among the civilised nations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Against</span> the manifold evils resulting from the destruction of
the empire by the Turks must be set off the dispersion of
Greek scholars throughout Italy and the consequent spread
of a knowledge of Greek literature throughout Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of Hellenism
upon
empire.</div>

<p>The Greeks of Athens and others belonging to the
Hellenic race continued during the whole period of the
existence of the empire to exercise a powerful influence
upon the thought of the empire, upon its government, and
upon the Church. At all times there were two influences
striving against each other for leadership, one Asiatic and
the other Hellenic. Without entering upon the interesting
question how far these different and often hostile tendencies
left their trace upon the Church and government, it is
sufficient for my present purpose to note that the Greek
influence prevailed for centuries and, aided by the commercial
spirit of the Greek race, which had given them the leading
part in the trade of the empire and hellenised every port
on the Aegean and the Marmora, succeeded in causing Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
speech to become the general language of the Church and
empire.</p>

<p>The Greeks who were of Hellenic blood had never forgotten
their own language or their classical writers. Others who
had adopted their language came in time to consider themselves
of Greek descent and gloried in the writings of
ancient Greece, as if they were the works of their ancestors.
Language and literature led to the belief in a common origin.
Just as Shakespeare and the English Bible are a bond of
union among English-speaking people, so the possession of
<span class="sidenote">Greek, a bond of union.</span>
the Greek classics, of the New Testament, and the Liturgies
of the Church knit together the various Greek-speaking
peoples under the empire. The common people learned to love
the old Greek stories, to treasure the beautiful half religious,
half mythical tales, the exploits recorded by Homer, no less
than the simple mixture of inspiriting and patriotic historical
narrative with the garrulous and ever pleasant stories of
Herodotus. A long series of successive generations were
nursed upon them, as they have indeed continued to be down
to the present day.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">539</a></p>

<p>There thus arose a traditional, historic, and patriotic
feeling which bound together all Greek-speaking peoples,
whether actually descendants from the Hellenic race or not.
It existed in all sections of the community and led to a
pride of race which has rarely been equalled. One curious
illustration of the affection which existed for their reputed
ancestors is noted by Dean Stanley and other writers. In
mediaeval pictures still remaining in the monasteries of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>Mount Athos and elsewhere, the originals of which were
painted many centuries ago, Pericles and Leonidas and
other great men of their race are introduced among the
occupants of heaven.</p>

<p>The wealthier classes, the scholars, the nobles and their
wives, down to the last period of the existence of the empire
aimed at speaking and writing Greek with elegance
and purity. They recognised that they were the heirs of
literary treasures which were greater than those possessed
by any other European people. They realised that in the
long series of Greek authors from classical times down
through nearly two thousand years to the period in which
they were living they had an historical literature longer and
more complete than any race known to them.</p>

<p>There had been indeed dark periods in the literary
history of the empire as in that of other countries. In
Constantinople during the four centuries which preceded
the Turkish conquest, though to a less extent than in
Western Europe, learning and literature had been largely
neglected. After the time of the great scholar Photius
(patriarch of Constantinople between 877 and 885) few
works of importance had been produced. The students of
Constantinople had come to take but small interest in any
study which did not concern theology, law, or history.
Possibly they ceased even to guard the treasures they
possessed with the like care which their predecessors had
<span class="sidenote">Disappearance of books after 1204.</span>
shown. Many valuable manuscripts disappeared. The Latin
conquerors are admittedly responsible for the destruction of
a large number of books. In the <i>Myriobiblion</i> of Photius, an
abridgment of two hundred and eighty authors which is
rich in extracts from historians, he gives us all we possess of
certain writers. But two thirds of the works he enumerates
have been lost since the time of the Fourth Crusade and
will probably never be recovered.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> No writer quotes any of
the lost authors after 1204.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">541</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Service
rendered
by empire
in preserving
Greek language
and
literature.</div>

<p>But beneath the cloud of ignorance which had descended
during the Middle Ages not only upon the empire but upon
all Europe, there were always in Constantinople a considerable
number of scholars and students. These men kept
alive the love of Greek learning. While none of them
produced any work which deserves to be classed as literature
of a high order, they rendered immense service by preserving
that which existed. The lawyers and clergy had greatly
assisted in maintaining the vigour and clearness of Greek
speech. The knowledge and practice of law in a form
not materially different from that in which it had been
left by the great jurists of the sixth and seventh centuries
furnished a field for the exercise of the most acute intellects,
and trained men in precision of thought and exactitude
of expression. The legal maxims of the lawyers of the
New Rome in their Latin form had given a set of principles
of law for all Europe, and still claim the admiration of
those who take pleasure in lucidity and epigram. The
dissensions and heresies in the Church in like manner
contributed to the use of Greek in a correct form. Exact
definition in matters of dogma was a necessity, and incidentally
helped to preserve Greek in its ancient form.
The writings of theologians were judged by a well-educated
caste which required that they should approximate to the
language which to them was accepted as a model.</p>

<p>The Histories of Nicetas, of Anna Comnena, of George
Acropolitas, of Pachymer, and of others down to Critobulus,
which help to fill up the period between the eleventh and
sixteenth centuries, are all written in respectable Greek and
show a feeling for literary effect which recalls, though it
too often seeks to imitate, the writings of the Greek classical
historians. The education of the higher clergy was in
Greek philosophy and theology; and schools for the study
of these subjects continued in existence down to the final
conquest. The remark of Gibbon is probably true that
‘more books and more knowledge were included within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>walls of Constantinople than could be found dispersed over
the extensive countries of the West.’<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">542</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure
of Greek
scholars
for Italy</div>

<p>While not losing sight of the fact that the Greek
Church from the time of Justinian had exercised influence
in Venice and Calabria, it may yet be stated that the departure
of Greek scholars from Constantinople for the West
began with the Latin conquest. Italy, on account of her
commerce with the East and the intimate relations which
had existed between Venice and other cities and the New
Rome before the Latin occupation, was the country to
which most of the fugitives turned their steps. Venice,
owing to the part she took in the Latin conquest of the
city, had become Queen of the Seas, and naturally received at
first the largest contingent. But the supremacy of Venice
was now shared by various rivals, and Greek students found
their way to other cities.</p>

<p>Greek was still spoken in Calabria, where the liturgy was
said in that language and where, indeed, the language is
still spoken,<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> but with this exception nowhere else in Italy
had any knowledge of Greek been preserved, Boccaccio
asserts that even the Greek characters were unknown.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> In
the troubles which existed during the century and a half
preceding the Moslem conquest the number of exiles
increased. Many priests and monks were glad to escape
from the disorders in their native land by seeking refuge in
Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">aids
revival of
learning
in Italy.</div>

<p>While these voluntary exiles contributed largely to
awaken an interest in the study of Greek, it must be noted
that their arrival in Italy was at an opportune period.
Gibbon remarks that in ‘the resurrection of science Italy
was the first that cast away her shroud.’ The study of the
Latin classical authors had already been recommenced.
There had been a gradual awakening from the stupor, the
indifference, and, in spite of a few individual exceptions, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>deep contented ignorance of the Middle Ages. Antiquity
as represented by its architecture, its sculpture, and its
literature, was now to furnish the ideal of the Renaissance.
A great movement arose for the reproduction of classical
architecture. But contemporary with it came the study of
Latin classics. Virgil had never been altogether neglected
and had, indeed, been regarded with a superstitious reverence.
He was now glorified and imitated. Other Latin authors
were diligently studied, and then the natural result followed.
The students of Cicero and Virgil began to look for their
models to the authors whom the Romans had admired and had
imitated. The study of the great Latin classics inevitably
called for a knowledge of those written in Greek. The
leaders in the revival of the study of the Latin authors were
those who led the way also in the study of Greek. Petrarch
and Boccaccio shared with Dante not merely the honour
of forming Italian as a modern language but that also of
leading the way to the appreciation of Greek learning by the
scholars of Western Europe. Greek scholars were welcomed.
We have seen that Barlaam, a Calabrian by birth, the short,
eager, stammering controversialist, whose bitter tongue,
learning, and subtilty made him the leader in the angry controversy
in Constantinople regarding the Inner Light in the
time of Cantacuzenus, was sent on an embassy to Italy by
the emperor. Cantacuzenus, though favouring the other
side, attests the learning and ability of Barlaam and his
acquaintance with Plato and Aristotle. At Avignon, he was
persuaded by Petrarch to act as instructor in Greek, and
with him the poet<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> read the works of Plato. Petrarch,
though his acquaintance with Greek did not enable him to
read the manuscript of Homer with which he had been
presented, yet speaks of the gift in terms which show his
admiration of Greek literature to have been profound and
enthusiastic. It is recorded of him that he was able to
select the greatest of the Greek poets by listening to the
reading of their works although he was unacquainted with
their language.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span></p>
<p>A few years afterwards, in 1360, Boccaccio, for twenty
years the friend of Petrarch, persuaded a certain Leontius
of Salonica, a pupil of Barlaam, to give public lectures upon
Homer at Florence. Leontius lodged in the house of Boccaccio,
was paid by the republic of Florence, and was probably the
first professor of Greek in Italy or any Western country.
His appearance was against him, for he was ill clad, had an
ugly face, with long unkempt hair and beard, and a sullen
manner. But all was excused on account of his knowledge
of the Greek language and his delight in its literature.
His public reading of Homer pleased the Florentines, and
Boccaccio obtained a prose translation of the Iliad and
Odyssey made by his <i>protégé</i>. At the end of three years
the lecturer resigned his post and went to Constantinople.
Boccaccio himself not only learned Greek but became
a lecturer throughout Italy upon its literature and helped
to create an enthusiasm for its study.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enthusiasm
in
Italy for
study of
Greek.</div>

<p>Manuel Chrysoloras, about 1366 or the following year,
after he had failed in his mission from the Emperor Manuel
to France and England to obtain aid against the Turks,
returned to Florence, the centre of the new intellectual
movement in Italy, to teach the Greek language and explain
its literature. His lectures were followed with delight.
Boys and old men were among his audience. The study of
Greek became the fashion. One of his pupils, Leonard
Aretinus, who subsequently became the secretary of four
successive Popes, tells how his soul was inflamed with the
love of letters and how on hearing Chrysoloras it was a hard
struggle to decide whether he should continue the study of
law or be introduced to Homer, Plato, Demosthenes, and
those poets, philosophers, and orators who are celebrated by
every age as the great masters of human science. He gave
himself up to Chrysoloras, and so strong, he declares, was his
passion for the new studies that the lessons he imbibed
during the day were the constant subject of his nightly
dreams.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></p>

<p>The school of Chrysoloras was transferred from Florence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>to Pavia, thence to Venice, and finally to Rome, and everywhere
was well attended. Aroused by his teaching, some of
his pupils went to Constantinople to increase their knowledge
of Greek and to acquire books and manuscripts. In that city,
between 1400 and 1453, the libraries and monasteries were
freely opened to the Italian students. The libraries were still
stocked with the treasures of Greek learning and literature,
and every effort was made by Italian scholars to draw upon
their stores. The trading agents of the Medici and other great
Florentine houses were instructed to buy manuscripts without
regard to cost and to send them to Florence. The best
credentials that a young Greek could bring from Constantinople
was a manuscript. The discovery of an unknown
manuscript, says Tiraboschi, was regarded almost as the
conquest of a kingdom. Aurispa, one of the pupils of Chrysoloras,
returned to Venice in 1423, with two hundred and
thirty-eight volumes.</p>

<p>The Florentines had led the way in the acquisition of
Greek and the collection of manuscripts. The chiefs of
the political factions were also the leaders of intellectual
progress and vied with each other in the noble rivalry of
encouraging the new studies as much as they did in building
libraries. Cosimo, the head of the Medici, carried out a well-organised
plan for encouraging the revived learning. The
leaders of his school in Florence were Niccolo di Nicolo
and Lionardo Bruni, the latter of whom died in 1443. The
chief ecclesiastics were hardly less eager than other scholars.
The popes themselves threw their influence into the new
movement. In 1434 Eugenius the Fourth took up his
residence in Florence when he was expelled from Rome.
Amid his own serious troubles, with refractory Councils, a
hostile capital, the Bogomil and Hussian heresies, and the
ever vexed question of the reunion of the Churches, Eugenius
found time to encourage the study of Greek and to give a
welcome to all Greek priests and students who brought with
them their precious manuscripts. He appreciated the profound
learning of Bessarion, archbishop of Nicaea, who had
come to take part in the council at Ferrara and afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
in 1438, at Florence, retained him, as we have seen, after
the Council, and made him in the following year cardinal.
His patronage of Bessarion is the more remarkable since the
Greek was an adherent and exponent of the philosophy of
Plato as opposed to that of Aristotle. The other Greek
Church dignitaries who were present at the Council, and
who were hardly less distinguished, were welcomed as
scholars even by those who treated them with scant courtesy
as priests of the Orthodox Church. George Gemistos, who
adopted the name of Plethon, the founder of a school of
Neoplatonism, was one of them, and was popular generally
except with the priests. George Scholarius, whom we have
seen as the leader of the anti-unionist party in Constantinople,
and afterwards as patriarch, Theodore Gaza, Andronicus,
Philelphus, and others of repute, were also present. Cosimo
de’ Medici, through the influence of Gemistos, undertook
the task of translating Plato. When Gemistos died, in
1450, in the Morea, his body was taken to Florence as a
mark of respect for his services in teaching Greek. The
patronage of Eugenius was continued by his successor
Nicholas the Fifth, the first ‘humanist’ who was made pope
and the founder of the Vatican library.</p>

<p>The succession of scholars was kept up by constant new
arrivals from Constantinople. Philelphus (or, in its Italianised
form, Filelfo), who had married a daughter of Chrysoloras,
was for a while secretary to the Venetian bailey in
Constantinople, and had gone thither in 1420 mainly in order
to study Greek. He was sent as envoy to Murad. He
states that, though when in Constantinople he found the
Greek of the common people much corrupted, yet that the
persons attached to the imperial court spoke the language of
Aristophanes and Euripides and of the historians and
philosophers of Athens, and that the style of their writing
continued to be elaborate and correct. It is especially
interesting to note that the most elegant and purest Greek
was spoken by the noble matrons.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> He gained, upon his
return to Italy, by his knowledge of Greek and his great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>learning, a wide reputation and came to be regarded as the
most universal scholar of the age. On his visit to Naples, in
1453, he was treated as an equal by princes.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> Many other
distinguished teachers also during the same period visited
Constantinople in pursuit of learning or manuscripts.</p>

<p>But while I have mentioned some of the leading Greeks
who contributed before the Moslem conquest to the revival of
the study of Greek literature in Italy, it should be noted that
there were a host of others less known to fame who sought
refuge from the disorders of the empire and found profitable
employment in their new homes. Between the death of
Petrarch, in 1374, and the conquest of Constantinople, in
1453, Italy had recovered the Greek classics. The intellectual
movement caused a great increase in the reproduction of
manuscripts. Among the professional copyists, those who
could write Greek were specially esteemed and received very
large pay.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> They did their work so admirably that the new
invention of printing with moveable types which came in
just about the time of the Moslem conquest of Constantinople
was regarded as unsuitable for, or unworthy of,
important books. The envoys of Cardinal Bessarion when
they saw for the first time a printed book in the house of
Constantine Lascaris laughed at the discovery ‘made among
the barbarians in some German city,’ and Ferdinand of
Urbino declared that he would have been ashamed to own
a printed book.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> Notwithstanding this prejudice, Greek
books were soon printed in Italy&mdash;though, for several years,
only in Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increased

<p>The impulse given to the study of Greek by exiles during
the half-century, preceding the conquest of Constantinople
and by the enthusiasm of a series of scholars from Petrarch
and Boccaccio down to 1453, was greatly stimulated by the
increase of fugitives consequent on the capture of the city.
Among the scholars who made their way westward the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>known are Lascaris, who rose to high distinction as a
statesman, Callistos, Argyropulos, Gaza, and Chalcondylas.
Between 1453 and the end of the century, Greek was
studied with avidity. Youths learned to speak as well as to
write it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renaissance
<i>in
excelsis</i>.</div>

<p>The arrival of numbers of scholars in Italy shortly before
and shortly after 1453 is contemporaneous with the full
springtime of the great revival of learning. A series of
remarkable efforts had been made to restore ancient Roman
and Greek glory as seen in literature and architecture.
Learning was regarded as a new and improved evangel.
The learning of the ancients was compared with the ignorance
of the Churchmen. The new movement marked a great
reaction and went to unjustifiable extremes. Some of the
advocates for classical influence went to the extent of discarding
Christian in favour of Pagan morality. A curious
passionate enthusiasm for the classic and venerated past
took possession of the most enlightened men in Italy.
Paganism, because it was contemporaneous with the
classical period, invaded the Church itself. All the architecture,
art, and literature of Christianity was bad except in
so far as it approximated to Pagan models. The late J. A.
Symonds gives a striking illustration of the distance this
enthusiasm carried men, in suggesting that Faust may be
taken as the symbol of the desire during the Renaissance for
classical learning. Faust is content to sell his soul to the
devil, but in return he sees Homer and Alexander and obtains
Helen as his bride and is satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> The careful study of
the Latin classics, the marvellous development of painting,
architecture, and sculpture, but, above all, the keen interest
felt in the newly developed study of Greek with its Platonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>philosophy and its new vision of life, were all to produce wonderful
fruit within a generation after 1453 and to culminate
in Italy in an age of singular intellectual brilliancy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Study of
Greek
taken up in
Northern
Europe.</div>

<p>The study of Greek, at first almost confined to Florence,
gradually spread over the whole of the peninsula and finally
passed north of the Alps into Germany, where it was taken
up with great earnestness. Opposed by the ignorant
monks everywhere, and by others who feared that the
authority and repute of Latin authors would be terminated,
it gradually won its way. In 1458 a Greek professor was
appointed in Paris, and one in Rome. Similar professorships
were established in most of the Italian universities,
following in this respect the example of Florence. In the
reign of Henry the Seventh, Oxford consented to receive
Grocyn and Linacre as teachers of Greek.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">552</a></p>

<p>As the zeal for a knowledge of Greek died out in Italy it
took deeper root in Germany. Chrysoloras and George of
Trebizond were followed by a succession of students, until we
meet with the names of Germans and Dutchmen who had
gone to Italy to make themselves acquainted with the
recovered language and literature. Among them that of
Erasmus holds the foremost place.</p>

<p>The movement known as ‘The Revival of Learning’ was
accomplished before the end of the fifteenth century, and all
investigators are agreed that it had been very largely
contributed to by Greek exiles during the half-century
preceding and following the Moslem conquest.</p>

<p>Its paganisation of Christianity proved temporary. But
the critical examination of the text of the Greek New
Testament and of the Greek Fathers had more durable
results. It called attention to the contents of a book which
had hitherto been taken as outside controversy. When the
study of Greek passed north of the Alps, the examination of
the sacred writings was no longer in the hands of <i>dilettanti</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>who looked upon the text with the contempt of scholars
disposed to accept paganism as the complement of a higher
form of civilisation, and who had no patience with what
they regarded as trivialities, but in those of religious and
earnest German students, with results, in Erasmus, Luther,
Melanchthon, Calvin, and others, the end of which is not yet
visible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MSS. destroyed
or
carried
away.</div>

<p>The manuscripts which were taken to Italy were the
seed destined to yield a rich literary harvest, and their removal
from Constantinople was an advantage. It is otherwise with
the manuscripts which perished. In 1204 the rude Venetians
and Crusaders destroyed great numbers for the sake of their
covers.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> A manuscript which had cost many months of
labour, which was written and perhaps illuminated with great
skill, was worthy of a costly covering. Some of the bindings
were enriched with jewels or with silver or gold clasps and
other decorations. The covers rather than the interior were
the objects then coveted. There is reason to believe that in
the two subsequent centuries thousands of manuscripts
disappeared, many possibly stolen or sold for their bindings.
But as learning in Constantinople made little progress
after the Latin occupation, it is probably to the ignorance
of the monks that the disappearance of many of them
ought to be attributed. Yet all the evidence which exists
shows that an enormous number of manuscripts remained
in Constantinople until 1453. We have seen that Ducas
declares that during the days following the sack of the city
ten volumes on theology and other studies, including Aristotle
and Plato, were sold for a small silver coin, and that an incredible
number of manuscripts of the Gospels after they had
been stripped of their gold and silver bindings were either
sold or given away.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> Critobulus adds that while a very great
number of books were burnt or ignominiously trampled to
pieces, the larger number were sold at ridiculous sums, not
for the sake of their price, but in contemptuous wantonness.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">555</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
I am unaware what authority Hody has for stating<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> that
after the capture of the city a hundred and twenty thousand
books were destroyed, but that the destruction was great
cannot reasonably be doubted.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">557</a></p>

<p>After the conquest the treasures guarded by the Greek
monks rapidly began to disappear, and especially from the
capital. The octagonal libraries, one of which formed
usually an adjunct to every church, were taken from the
Christians by the victorious Turk and applied to other uses,<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">558</a>
and the contents were for the most part dispersed or destroyed.
Successive travellers for two centuries found rich
gleanings among them, and the number of manuscripts taken
or sent away suggests that the original stores in Constantinople
had been enormous. Janus Lascaris returned to Italy
with two hundred books, eighty of which were as yet unknown
in the libraries of Europe. Even as late as the time
of Busbeck, who was ambassador of the Holy Roman
Emperor to Suliman in 1555, he was able to conclude the
announcement of his return home by saying: ‘I have whole
wagon-loads, if not ship-loads, of Greek manuscripts, and
about two hundred and forty books which I sent by sea to
Venice. I intend them for Caesar’s library. I rummaged
every corner to provide such kind of merchandise as my
final gleaning.’<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">559</a></p>

<p>While it is beyond doubt that the dispersion of students
from Constantinople aided the intellectual movement in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>Western Europe by introducing new ideals of poetry, of
history, and of philosophy, as well as by modifying the
conceptions of classical art and architecture,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> there is no
ground for the belief that, if the city had not been captured,
Greek influence would not have made itself felt in the
Renaissance. The dispersion hastened the development of a
movement which had already begun, awakened a spirit of
inquiry, and conducted scholars into new fields of thought
earlier than they would have arrived if not thus aided. In
this sense, and to this extent, it may be claimed as a
beneficial result of the capture of Constantinople.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> capture of Constantinople marked an epoch in the
world’s history. The dispersion of its scholars and its
treasures of learning leavened Western thought; the lessons
gained from Turkish warfare, from the discipline of the
Janissaries and the mobility of the army were learned by
European states. These results entitle the event to be
regarded as of importance, but another, the conviction,
namely, brought home to Europe of the significance of the
capture, helps still further to entitle it to be regarded as
epoch-marking. The Slavic and Teutonic as well as the
Greek and Latin races had been developing for centuries,
unchecked by any external influence, in the direction of
human progress which we understand by the word ‘civilisation.’
From Ireland to Constantinople and even to the
banks of the Euphrates all the peoples had accepted
Christianity, a religion which had not been substantially
changed either in dogma or discipline by any of the various
races included in the above area, a religion which had aided
them to develop the morality, the habits and customs, the
thoughts and ideals, which are comprehended in the
modern conception of civilisation. The capture of Constantinople
was the intrusion into this Christian area of a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
force, with a different morality, and with a tendency hostile
to the habits, customs, and aspirations which it encountered.
The capture was the latest step in a series of successful
efforts to detach a large mass of territory from the area of
European civilisation. As large sections of the empire had
during successive centuries been lost, Constantinople came
to stand in her loneliness as the representative of European
ideals of Christianity. When the city was taken, Western
statesmen were compelled to recognise that the remaining
European area of civilisation was face to face with an
Asiatic, a non-Christian, and a necessarily hostile movement.
The European peoples, for the first time during centuries,
were awakened from their dream of security and saw the
possibility of the advance of races professing the creed
which had been held by those who in the early days of
Islam had utterly rooted out the civilisation and Christianity
of North Africa. The shock and alarm were universal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alarm
created in
Europe.</div>

<p>The military reputation of the Turk was enormously increased
by the capture of Constantinople. Hallam justly
observes that though the fate of the city had been protracted
beyond all reasonable expectation, the actual intelligence
operated like that of a sudden calamity. ‘A sentiment of
consternation, perhaps of self-reproach, thrilled to the heart
of Christendom.’<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> Those who knew what the progress of the
Turks had been and how numerous and mobile were the
hordes at the disposal of the sultan were the most
anxious regarding their further progress. The podestà of
Pera, writing within a month after the capture, declares that
Mahomet intended to become lord of the whole earth and
that before two years were over he would go to Rome and
‘By God, unless the Christians take care, or there are
miracles worked, the destruction of Constantinople will be
repeated in Rome.’<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> Other contemporary writers express
the like dismay. Aeneas Sylvius, in the presence of the
diet of Frankfort, pointed out that by the capture of
Constantinople Hungary lay open to the conqueror, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>declared that if that country were subdued Italy and Germany
would be open to invasion.</p>

<p class="tb">The rapid extension of their power by sea as well as by
land was soon a constant source of anxiety to the nations
whose territory bordered on the Mediterranean. Piratical
expeditions upon their shores with the object of carrying off
slaves kept them in perpetual alarm. When Don John of
Austria, in 1571, defeated the Turkish fleet at Lepanto, the
dread of the victorious Turk was so acute and the relief at
the completeness of his victory so great that the Venetians
congratulated each other with the cry that the Devil was
dead, and the pope commemorated the great triumph by
preaching from the text ‘There was a man sent from God
whose name was John.’</p>

<p>From the capture in 1453 until John Sobieski relieved
Vienna, upwards of two centuries later, the universal topic of
European politics, quiescent for a few years but constantly
becoming paramount, was the progress made by the Grand
Turk. During the whole of this period he had continued to
be the terror of Europe.</p>

<p>La Brocquière, who had noted the traffic in Christian
slaves by the Turks and the oppression of their Christian
subjects, remarked that it was a shame and scandal to Europe
to allow herself to be terrorised by such a race. A succession
of travellers from the West, who, one after another, observed
the sufferings of the Christians, the misgovernment of the
Turkish empire, its rapid increase, and the widespread terror
of the Turkish name, vainly endeavoured to show how the
Turks might be defeated; but their victorious progress was
unchecked until 1683.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">563</a></p>

<p>The results of the destruction of the empire were of a
uniformly disastrous character. Constantinople, which had
been the heart of the empire and for centuries the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>bulwark of European civilisation, became the stronghold of
the professors of a hostile creed. After aiding Europe by
resisting the long encroachments of the Turks, it had first
become an isolated outpost of Christianity surrounded by
hostile hordes, and then, after a century of struggle, not
altogether inglorious, had been overwhelmed by them. By
its capture Europe lost all that its citizens might have contributed
to civilisation. The philosophy, art, theology, and
jurisprudence which had emanated from its schools had,
happily, leavened Western lands&mdash;happily, because after the
conquest the city ceased to exercise any influence on
European thought. Under the rule of its new masters it
was destined to become the most degraded capital in Europe,
and became incapable of contributing anything whatever of
value to the progress of the human race. No art, no literature,
no handicraft even, nothing that the world would gladly
keep, has come since 1453 from the Queen City. Its capture,
so far as human eyes can see, has been for the world a misfortune
almost without any compensatory advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results
upon
Christian
subjects.</div>

<p>The disastrous results of the conquest fell with greatest
force upon the conquered subjects of the empire. The great
cry which went up from the Christians who had fallen under
Turkish rule, and which has never ceased to be justified
among their descendants to the present hour, was that the
new rulers failed in the primary duty of government&mdash;to
render life and property secure. Tried by a higher standard
of good government, as an institution which should secure to
its subjects justice, the rule of the Turk fell immeasurably
short. The Christians became <i>rayahs</i> or cattle, and as such
were legally incapable of possessing the same rights as
Moslems. While an analogy to such inequality might be
found in other countries, in Turkey the Christians found
that the rights which even the law of the conquerors
accorded them were denied. Their property was arbitrarily
seized. They were constantly harassed and pillaged
by their Mahometan neighbours and no redress could
be obtained in the law courts, for Christian testimony
was not admissible against the word of a Moslem. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
effects of this legal inequality were soon apparent and have
continued to the present day. The Christians were tillers of
the ground, artificers, or merchants. Their earnings exposed
them to the envy of their Moslem neighbours, who, being
less experienced in agriculture or less skilful in trade, less
energetic and less intelligent, were unable, as they are still, to
compete with them successfully. Their superior power of
creating wealth, rather than the fanaticism of a hostile creed,
has from the time of the conquest led to fierce outrages
upon the Christians and to raids upon their property, and
when combined with such fanaticism has produced the
periodical massacres which have occurred during nearly
every decade in Turkish history.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the Christian traders and agriculturists
were greatly increased by the conduct of the conquerors in
allowing the great roads and bridges to get out of repair.
Turkish ignorance, contempt for industry and commerce,
belief that such matters were only of interest to unbelievers,
led even the governing class to allow the public works
which they had found in the country to fall into ruin.
The traveller in Asia Minor and in European Turkey finds
everywhere the remains of roads once well constructed and
well preserved, which the Turks have made few or no efforts
to maintain, reconstruct, or replace. The destruction or
decay of the means of communication coupled with the
want of security soon made it useless for the Christian tiller
of the soil to engage in agriculture or even increase his
flocks and herds. The surplus over what was necessary to
supply his own wants could not be taken to market.
Abundance of evidence shows that the Christians in
almost every part of the empire had possessed large flocks
and herds of cattle. These, indeed, formed a special
temptation to the Turks, who at all times since their entry
into Asia Minor and Europe were given to making raids on
neighbouring Christian lands. After the conquest it soon
became useless for the Christians to attempt to keep a form
of property which was so easily carried off. Those who in
spite of all obstacles contrived to save a few hundred aspers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
became objects of envy to their Moslem neighbours and
carefully hid their little savings. The want of security and
the absence of roads were evils which the Christian shared,
though to a less extent, with the Turk. All inducements to
the accumulation of wealth, but especially for Christians,
were removed, till at length all alike ceased to save or do
more work than was necessary to keep body and soul together.
Nor can it be said that the condition of the
population under Turkish rule has in this respect greatly
improved at the present day. In the interior of the empire
the man who has acquired a little wealth is careful not to
appear better off than his neighbours. In the capital and a
few seaports, Christians had a somewhat better chance, but
even there the practice of squeezing a wealthy Greek or Armenian
merchant and stripping him of his property lingered
into the last century and is even yet not altogether extinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Population
impoverished,</div>

<p>Poverty as the consequence of misgovernment is the
most conspicuous result of the conquest affecting the
population of the empire. Lands were allowed to go out of
cultivation. Industries were lost. Mines were forgotten.
Trade and commerce almost ceased to exist. Population
decreased. The wealthiest state in Europe became the
poorest; the most civilised became the most barbarous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and demoralised.</div>

<p>The demoralisation of the conquered people and of their
churches resulting from the conquest and especially from
the poverty it produced were not less disastrous than the
injury to their material interests. The Christians lost heart.
Their physical courage lessened. In remote districts, and
especially in mountainous regions, where the advantage of
natural position counterbalanced the enormously superior
numbers of the enemy, the Christians continued to resist.
The Greeks in Epirus gave a good account of themselves
during centuries, while the Armenians round about Zeitoun
and the inhabitants of Montenegro even continued to keep
something like independence. But the Greek, Bulgarian,
and Armenian populations, all of whom had fought well
in resisting the Turks, became less virile. Grinding poverty
and constant, though usually petty, oppression even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
than the periodical massacres took away from them much of
their manliness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Degradation
of
Church.</div>

<p>The influence of the conquest upon the Orthodox Church
was purely mischievous. The ecclesiastical revenues were
seized. The priests had to eke out a living on the
miserable pittances they could obtain from performing the
services of the Church for an impoverished people, and soon
came to be chosen from the peasant class. Poverty of the
flock meant poverty throughout the hierarchy. Learning
declined and disappeared. The parish priest knew his office
by heart, but in course of time hundreds of priests were
unable to understand the classic words and phrases with
which the liturgy of Chrysostom and others employed in the
Eastern Church abound. The most commodious churches
were transformed into mosques. The libraries perished.
Thousands of precious manuscripts were destroyed. The
means of obtaining an educated clergy no longer existed.
The voice of the preacher was regarded with suspicion, and
the Orthodox Church as a power for the education of its
congregations became almost valueless. There were no
longer any heresies or dissensions which invited discussion,
for people and clergy were alike sunk in ignorance. The
art of preaching was forgotten. Religious teaching or
expression of thought in or out of the Church almost
ceased to exist. The Church of Chrysostom was condemned
to silence. To all appearances, there was little or no
consciousness of lofty ideals or aspirations towards them.
Piety, as understood in the West, seemed for centuries
to be unknown. A book like the ‘Imitatio’ or even
the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ would have been unintelligible.
Churches as well as people had become sordid and destitute
of aspiration. Ignorance and other causes, due to the
conquest, reduced the Churches to a stagnant level of uniformity,
superstition, and spiritual death.</p>

<p>With the substitution of an ignorant for a learned priesthood
the influence of the Church upon Western Europe
ceased. Down to the conquest it had not only claimed an
equality with the Latin Church, but its learning was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
respected by popes, cardinals, and scholars, who recognised
that it merited gratitude for its guardianship of Christian
learning and for the succession of scholars who had
expounded the treasures of its literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Benefits
conferred
by Church.</div>

<p>Yet amid all the meanness and debasement of the
Christian Churches it should ever be remembered that they
rendered to their people two inestimable services. They
helped to preserve family life and to keep the great mass of
their members from abandonment of the Christian profession.
However abject the Church, however subservient
at times its leaders became to the Ottoman rulers, and
however we of the twentieth century may despise priestly
pretensions and the claims of any body of men to have a
supernatural commission, it is a duty to recognise that the
service rendered by the Churches to the Christian subjects of
the sultan, and indeed to humanity, in preserving the habits
of family life was immeasurably great. One may fully
admit that the priests were ignorant, and that the Church
became more than ever saturated with pagan superstition;
but it safeguarded the idea of Christian marriage based upon
the union of the husband for life with one wife. Children
were reared in the companionship of a father and mother
to each of whom chastity and the necessity of forsaking all
others was not merely a tradition and an ideal, but a duty
enjoined by the universal teaching of the Church. The
results of the education of children amid such teaching,
tradition, and environment can only be appreciated when
they are compared with those which are produced among
their Moslem neighbours, where, under a system fatal to
family life, the mother holds a position immeasurably
inferior to that of the father.</p>

<p>The Church also helped to prevent the Christian
population from abandoning their religious belief, and, to
the philosophical student of religions hardly less than to
Christians, this result should be regarded as pure gain.
The Christians were permitted to have their own religious
services, and the attempt was seldom made forcibly to convert
them to Mahometanism. The teaching of Mahomet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
that the ‘People of the Books’ were not to be molested so
long as they submitted and paid tribute, usually secured a
contemptuous toleration of their worship. There was little
formal interference with their religious practices. Their
processions, rites, and ceremonies only encountered opposition
from the fanatical brutality of individuals, though
Christian worshippers were constantly exposed to petty
persecutions from persons in authority who expressed their
dislike and loathing of Christianity in a thousand different
<span class="sidenote">Inducements to renounce Christianity.</span>
ways. But it must always be remembered to the credit of
the Christians that abandonment of their faith would at
any time have saved them from all persecution and have
placed them on an equality with their conquerors. The
singularly democratic creed and practice of Islam at once
open every preferment to the convert. The negro, the
Central Asiatic, no less than the Christian rayah, once he
has pronounced the <i>Esh-had</i>, is on an equality in theory and
in practice with the descendant of the Prophet. Turkish
history abounds with instances of renegades or their sons
rising to the highest positions in the state. A Christian
who accepted Islam had every career open to him. The
Christian subjects of the empire have always been aware
of their own superiority in intellectual capacity to their
Turkish neighbours. This superiority is manifest in every
country where Moslems and Christians live side by side. It
is mainly due to the inferior position assigned in practice in
every Mahometan country to woman, a position illustrated
by the custom of repudiation&mdash;which the husband may exercise
in lieu of divorce&mdash;by the lack of family life in which children
are nurtured in the companionship of both parents, and even
by the absence of a family name.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">564</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span></p>
<p>It would indeed have been remarkable if with the
unspeakable advantages of family life on their side the
Christians had not been superior in capacity to their
neighbours. But, in spite of their lively consciousness of
such superiority and of the advantages to be gained by
perversion, few Christians became renegades.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Degradation
of
people.</div>

<p class="tb">But, notwithstanding the fact that their refusal to
abandon a higher for a lower form of religion must be
accounted to them for righteousness, the Christians passed
into a Slough of Despond. Disarmed and oppressed, they
became demoralised and lost self-respect. Their progress
and development, material, intellectual, and moral, was
arrested. They fell back upon deceit and cunning and the
other vices with which a subjugated people seeks to defend
itself against its oppressors and which are the usual characteristics
of a people held in bondage. The most disastrous
result of the conquest upon the people was to create a low
standard of morality, and, as in the course of time habits
form character, this result endured and continues to the
present day. Dishonesty, unfair dealing, bribery, and untruthfulness
came to be regarded among all the Christian races of
the Ottoman Empire as venial offences or as pardonable
blunders. This deterioration of character was not, and is
not, confined to laymen. The environment of all classes has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>been powerful for evil, and the standards in particular of
commercial honesty generally prevalent in Christian nations
have neither been preserved nor attained.</p>

<p>Under Turkish rule punishment often failed to follow
detection. In some cases&mdash;notably, for example, bigamy&mdash;the
conquering race recognises no offence and therefore awards
no punishment. The Christians had and have so little confidence
in their chance of obtaining justice that it is the exception
to prosecute an offender. A man will rather suffer
loss than waste his time in appealing to a court where he
knows that he will certainly incur expense and inconvenience
and that the offender, provided he can pay, can escape
condemnation. It is to this impossibility of obtaining justice
that must be ascribed more perhaps than to any other cause
the lowering of the morals of Eastern Christians. Those who
know them best, from Arab Christians in Syria to the Greeks
and others in Constantinople and the Balkan Peninsula,
and whose sympathies are entirely with them in the persecution
they have undergone, and in their desire to shake
off the oppressor’s yoke, have regretfully to confess that the
reputation which they have acquired in Western Europe for
untrustworthiness and untruthfulness is not undeserved.
Happily, in Greece and other countries which have been
freed from Turkish misrule there are abundant signs of an
awakening to the necessity of regarding offences from a
loftier standpoint and of presenting in the Churches a
higher ideal of morality; signs, too, of the public opinion
which is bringing these countries into line with Western
states.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">565</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
conquest
on Turks.</div>

<p>The conquest of Constantinople had but little effect on
the mass of the Turkish population. The Turks ceased to
be mainly a nomadic people, and great numbers of them took
possession of the arable lands of the conquered races. But
in other respects their habits and characteristics remained
unchanged. They had and have their virtues. They are
brave and hardy, and, except when under the influence of
religious fanaticism, are hospitable and kindly. Their
religion inculcates cleanliness and sobriety. While its
teaching must stand condemned in regard to the treatment
of non-Islamic peoples and, judging by the universal experience
of Moslem countries, in regard to the position, fatal
to all progress, which it assigns to woman, it has nevertheless
helped to diffuse courtesy and self-respect among its
adherents. Unhappily, the Turkish race has never had
sufficient continuous energy to be industrious nor enough
intelligence to desire knowledge.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the populations under the rule of the
Turk, his religious intolerance has only become virulent at
intervals; for when his fanaticism is awakened, corruption
and cruelty in the administration of government show
themselves at their worst. It is so in Morocco now, where
the fiercest Moslem intolerance and perhaps the most cruel
and corrupt government in the world co-exist. It has been
so at various periods under Turkish rule. Sultans have
alternated in their government between periods of lethargy,
sloth, and sensuality and those of spasmodic activity. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>the periods of fanaticism have been those not only of
massacre and exceptional cruelty but of want of patriotism,
and the worst corruption in the administration of government.</p>

<p>In Greece and Italy more vigorous physical races in
earlier times had triumphed over peoples further advanced
in civilisation. But the conquerors profited by the civilisation
of the vanquished and the latter became more virile.
The two races coalesced and formed a united people. No
such results followed 1453. The Turkish nation was unable
to assimilate the civilisation of the peoples it subdued, and
its work has been simply to destroy what it could not take
to itself. It has fallen so far short of reconciling the
conquered races and welding them to itself so as to form
one people that the assertion may safely be made that
every century since 1453 has widened the gulf between it
and the Christians.</p>

<p>In one respect only has the Turk been able to appreciate
the progress made by his neighbours and, in part at least,
to appropriate their development&mdash;namely, in the art of war.
He knows and cares nothing about art, science, or literature.
He has made a miserable failure of government. His civil
administration is probably more corrupt than it was four
centuries ago. He admits that, since his defeat at Lepanto
in 1571, Allah has given the dominion of the seas to the
Giaours. But as a soldier he has always been ready to
learn from European nations.</p>

<p>That the heavy weight of misrule has hindered and still
continues to hinder the progress of the Christian races is
attested by all who are acquainted with Turkey. Condemned
to constant persecution and a sordid poverty which
leaves on travellers an overpowering sense of human misery,
and living amid a hopeless and dispiriting environment,
they passed into the blackest night which ever overshadowed
a Christian people. It is true that they were not
utterly destroyed, as other Christian nations have been, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
except for the feeling of solidarity arising from community
of race and of religious belief and for the hope which
the Churches aided them to keep alive, their night was
without a single ray of light. They and their countrymen
who had escaped into foreign lands looked in despair
and in vain for the signs that the night would pass. It is
barely a century ago since the keener-sighted watchmen
observed indications of dawn. The daylight has arisen
upon Roumania, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and other
countries once under Turkish rule, and signs of dawn are
visible, though with indications of blood-red, in Macedonia
and Armenia. Sooner or later, but as surely as light overcomes
darkness, the Christian and progressive elements
in the Turkish empire will see the day and rejoice in it.</p>

<p>The friends of the liberated territories have often complained
of the vagaries, the inconstancy, and the slow rate
of progress of the re-established states. They are apt to
forget that to shake off the effects of centuries of bondage
is a task which has never been accomplished in a single
generation. All historical precedents, from the time when
Moses led the children of Israel into the desert, teach the
same lesson. But it is satisfactory to note that while
each of the states that have obtained emancipation was, a
century ago, far behind the civilisation even of Constantinople,
it is now far ahead of it. If the traveller who
eighty years ago spoke contemptuously of the collection of
mud huts which fanatics are pleased to call Athens, while
they refer to their barbarian occupants as Greeks, could
now be placed on the Acropolis, he would see the well-built
and prosperous capital of a country which, in spite of
financial difficulties, is flourishing in agriculture, trade, and
commerce; the chief city of a people which has recovered
its self-respect, is full of patriotism, of zeal for education,
and of intellectual life, and whose Church has awakened to
the necessity of an educated priesthood and a higher
standard of morality. A like prosperity could be noted in
every other land which has escaped from Turkish bondage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
Wherever, indeed, the dead weight of Turkish misrule has
been removed, the young Christian states have been fairly
started on the path of civilisation and justify the reasonable
expectations of the statesmen, historians, and scholars of the
West who have sympathised with and aided them in their
aspirations for freedom.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX I</h2>

<p class="center">NOTE ON ROMANUS GATE AND CHIEF PLACE OF
FINAL ASSAULT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> doubt exists as to the position of the Romanus Gate mentioned
by the historians of the siege, and as this position determines
those of the great gun, of the stockade, and of the principal
place of the final assault, it is desirable to endeavour to set such
doubt at rest.</p>

<p>What I desire to show may be summed up in the following
propositions.</p>

<p>(1) That contemporary writers agree in stating that the principal
place of attack and the final assault was at or near the Gate
of St. Romanus.</p>

<p>(2) That the present Top Capou had long been known as the
Gate of St. Romanus.</p>

<p>(3) That there is evidence to demonstrate that the final assault
was not at or near Top Capou but in the Lycus valley.</p>

<p>(4) That the Pempton is the Gate referred to by contemporary
writers as the Romanus Gate.</p>

<p>Among the evidence showing that the principal place of attack
was at or near the Romanus Gate is the following:</p>

<p>Barbaro (p. 21) states that four great guns were ‘alla porta
de San Romano dove che sun la piu debel porta de tuta la tera.
Una de queste quatro bombarde che sun a la porta da San
Romano’ was the big gun cast by Orban. On p. 16 he speaks of
an attack as being against ‘le mure da tera de la banda de San
Romano.’ On p. 26 he mentions the destruction of a tower, presumably
the Bactatinean, spoken of by Leonard. This tower was
‘de la banda de San Romano.’ It was destroyed by the big gun
with a portion also of the wall (‘con parechi passa de muro’). On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
p. 27 he describes the repair of the walls going on at the Gate
called San Romano. On p. 40 he again says that the weakest
place in the landward walls was at San Romano, ‘dove che iera
roto le mure.’ On p. 53 he adds that the Turks fought furiously
‘da la banda da tera, da la banda de San Romano dove che iera
el pavion’ of the emperor. On the same page he describes them
again as still fighting ‘da la banda de San Romano.’ On p. 55
he describes the entry of the Turks into the city as being ‘da la
banda de San Romano,’ and on p. 57 he states that the emperor
was killed at the entry which the Turks had made ‘a la porta de
San Romano.’ According, therefore, to Barbaro, the Romanus
Gate is the central place of attack and of capture.</p>

<p>But Barbaro was a Venetian, and probably did not know the
city well. Phrantzes and Ducas, however, were citizens. The
first, on p. 254, says that Justiniani took charge of the defence ἐν τοῖς μέρεσι τῆς
πύλης τοῦ ἁγίου Ῥωμανοῦ, which the Bonn editor translates
correctly by saying that he defended the ‘regionem ad portam
Sancti Romani.’ Phrantzes further identifies the place by saying
it was where the Turks had stationed their largest gun because
the walls were convenient for attack and because the sultan’s tent
was pitched opposite. As to the position of the sultan’s tent
Phrantzes and others say that it was opposite the Romanus Gate.
Ducas, however, states that it was opposite the Chariseus or
Adrianople Gate. Phrantzes, p. 287, says further that the emperor
and many soldiers fell ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ἐκείνῳ πλησίον τῆς πύλης
τοῦ ἁγίου Ῥωμανοῦ where the Turks had built their wooden tower and
stationed their largest gun. Ducas says that the Turks placed
this big gun near (πλησίον) the Romanus Gate. He further describes
the destruction of the tower (presumably the Bactatinean
mentioned by Leonard) which was near the Romanus Gate.
Other authors could be cited who use similar expressions.</p>

<p>In fact, all the evidence is in favour of my first proposition,
that the principal place of attack was at or near the Romanus
Gate.</p>

<p>(2) It is undisputed that Top Capou (that is, Cannon Gate) was
known in early times as the Gate of St. Romanus. It is mentioned
under that name, for example, in the ‘Paschal Chronicle’ in
the time of Heraclius, and again in the reign of Andronicus the
First by Nicephorus Gregoras (ix. ch. 6), and as late as the middle
of the fourteenth century by Cantacuzenus (p. 142, Ven. ed.).</p>

<p>(3 &amp; 4) The evidence to show that the final assault was not at
or near Top Capou is abundant.</p>

<p>Owing, however, to the constant mention of St. Romanus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
the undoubted association of that name with Top Capou, it has
been naturally assumed that the chief place of attack was at or
near the latter Gate. Even Paspates was driven to disregard the
evidence of his own eyes and to fix the assault on the steep part
of the slope near Top Capou (Πολιορκία, p. 186).</p>

<p>But all observers who have studied the question on the spot,
with the exception of Paspates, are now agreed that the chief
place of assault was in the Lycus valley. In such case it
necessarily follows that the name Romanus was given during the
siege to some other gate than Top Capou.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Dethier was the first to suggest that the Gate
spoken of by the contemporaries of the siege as St. Romanus was
the Pempton. Let us examine the evidence. It is worthy of note
that Phrantzes places Justiniani in the ‘region’ or district of the
Romanus Gate. The Italian writers, knowing less of the city, say
‘at’ such Gate.</p>

<p>Now what was the Pempton? Each of the two Civil Gates
on the landward side which we need here regard&mdash;namely, Top
Capou and the Adrianople Gate&mdash;crowned a hill on one side of the
Lycus valley and was exceptionally strong. They formed, in fact,
with their towers and barbicans two of the strongest positions in
the landward walls. The bridges across the foss opposite these
and the other Civil Gates were intended to be broken down during
a siege, and in fact were broken down when Mahomet’s siege
commenced.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> The Military Gates which led from the city to
the Peribolos were then opened, though they were generally walled
up in times of peace. The Pempton or Fifth Military Gate or
Gate of the Fifth (for both forms of names are found) was the one
which gave access to the Enclosure in the Lycus valley. It was
known also in early times as the Gate of St. Kyriakè, from a
neighbouring church, and as the Gate of Puseus from a Latin
inscription still existing upon it, dating probably from the time of
Leo the First, recording that Puseus had strengthened it.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">567</a></p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that no writer who was either a witness
of the siege or subsequently wrote upon it mentions the Pempton
either under that name or by those of Kyriakè or Puseus. It is
impossible to believe that it was not used. It was built for the
express purpose of giving access to the troops into the Peribolos
within which, beyond all doubt, the most important fighting took
place. To admit that Justiniani and the soldiers under him were
stationed between the Outer and the Inner Walls in this part and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>yet to suggest that the Pempton was not used is altogether unreasonable.
Dethier’s suggestion is, that when the Civil Gates
were closed people gave to the Military Gate the name of the
nearest Civil Gate. Probably the earlier names given on account
of their numbers were generally unknown. The latest instance I
have found of the use of Pempton is in the ‘Paschal Chronicle.’</p>

<p>In support of this view it is important to note that many contemporaries
speak of another place where the cannonading was
severe as at the Pegè Gate (as, for example, Barbaro and Philelphus),
whereas no one doubts that the present condition of the
walls affords conclusive evidence that the writers intended to
indicate Triton&mdash;that is, the Third Military Gate between the Pegè
and the Rhegium Civil Gates.</p>

<p>The suggestion that the Pempton was commonly called the
Romanus Gate explains various statements which are otherwise
irreconcilable. We have seen that Ducas says that the sultan
was encamped opposite the Chariseus Gate, while Phrantzes
places him opposite the Romanus. Dr. Mordtmann urges<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> that
from the small knoll where, according to Ducas and Critobulus,
Mahomet’s tent was pitched, an observer might fairly describe its
position as opposite either, but if the Pempton were called
Romanus, such a suggestion would be much more plausible.
Again, Barbaro, as already quoted, places the great gun opposite
the San Romano Gate because this was the weakest gate of all the
city. But on p. 18 he uses the same phrase in stating that the
‘Cressu’ or Chariseus was the weakest gate in all the city, the
explanation being, I think, that as the Pempton was about midway
between the Romanus and the Chariseus Civil Gates he heard
it called indifferently by either name. Tetaldi, the Florentine soldier
who was present at the siege, states that two hundred fathoms of
Outer Wall were broken down during the last days. Now, although
the Inner Wall was repaired by Mahomet<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> and continued fairly
complete, no attempt appears to have been made to rebuild the
Outer.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> The spectator has little difficulty in distinguishing where
the twelve hundred feet of Outer Wall of which Tetaldi speaks
was destroyed. It was opposite the Pempton and, judging from
the condition of the walls, certainly not opposite the present Top
Capou. But the same writer says that it was ‘à la porte de
Sainct Romain.’<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> The Moscovite or Slavic chronicler says that
the great cannon were placed opposite the station of Justiniani
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>‘because the walls there were less solid and very low,’<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> a description
which would not apply to those near Top Capou, but which,
like all the descriptions given, does apply to the lower part of the
Lycus valley. Here, in the phrase of Professor van Millingen,
was the heel of Achilles, the Valley of Decision.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> The weakness
of this portion of the walls is illustrated by the fact that when
Baldwin the Second expected an attack by Michael he walled up
all the landward gates ‘except the single one near the streamlet
where one sees the church of St. Kyriakè’&mdash;that is, except the
Pempton.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> In other words, the walls being there the weakest, it
was anticipated that there would be the attack, and the entry into
the Peribolos must be kept open to defend the Outer Wall. In the
‘Threnos’ the siege is described as being at the ‘Chariseus Gate,’
now St. Romanus, which is called Top Capou.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> Apparently the
confusion in this description is hopeless, but if the Pempton were
called indifferently, as by Barbaro, Romanus and Chariseus, it
becomes intelligible.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></p>

<p>A statement by the ‘Moscovite’ (ch. vii.) also points to the
Pempton as the chief point of attack. He mentions that on
April 24 a ball from the great cannon knocked away five of the
battlements and buried itself in the walls of a church. The only
church in the neighbourhood either of Top Capou or the Pempton
was one dedicated to St. Kyriakè, which was in the Lycus valley
near the Pempton. But the attack is always stated to be against
the Romanus Gate.</p>

<p>Near the Pempton the Peribolos is now about twenty feet
higher than the level of the ground on the city side of the Great
Wall. Beyond doubt this is largely due to the accumulation of
refuse and broken portions of the wall, but, allowing for this, an
observer will probably conclude that the Peribolos was at the
time of the siege several feet higher than the level on the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>side. This same discrepancy of level did not exist&mdash;if, indeed, any
existed&mdash;at Top Capou. Hence when the small gate was opened
from the city by Justiniani to give easier access to the stockade,
men had to ascend to it. This is what Critobulus implies they
had to do. The gate was opened to lead ἐπὶ τὸ σταύρωμα (lx. 2).</p>

<p>Critobulus states that Mahomet drew up his camp ‘before the
<i>Gates</i> of Romanus.’<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> The argument Dethier draws from the
plural, ‘gates,’ is not perhaps worth much, but it is remarkable
that in speaking of other gates Critobulus usually employs the
singular: as, for example, in ch. xxvii. 3, ‘The Wood-Gate, as far
as the gate called Chariseus.’ Gregoras also employs the plural:
παρὰ τὰς πύλας τοῦ Ῥωμανοῦ (Book ix. ch. vi.).</p>

<p>The Turkish writers throw very valuable light on the question
and show clearly that the assault was not at Top Capou, but
rather nearer the Adrianople Gate.</p>

<p>The imaum Zade Essad-Effendi says that in the final assault
Hassan mounted the broken wall where the Franks were defending
it, ‘which wall was to the south of Edirne Capou’&mdash;that is, of the
Adrianople Gate. The Turkish writer Sad-ud-din, who died in
1599, gives similar testimony. He states that Constantine
‘entrusted to the Frank soldiers the defence of those breaches
which were on the south side of the Adrianople Gate.’ And
again: ‘The Turks in the final assault did not rush to the gates
but to the breaches that were made in the broken wall between
Top Capou and the Adrianople Gate, and, after the capture, went
round and opened the gates from the inside, the first to be opened
being the Adrianople Gate.’<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> If the Venetian and Genoese soldiers
had been near Top Capou the writer would not have described
their position as he does. Probably he was ignorant of any name
for the gate in the valley where the assault occurred, and therefore
describes the breaches with sufficient accuracy as south of
the Adrianople or Edirne Gate.</p>

<p>Lastly, Dr. Mordtmann calls attention to the fact that on old
Turkish maps the Pempton is marked as Hedjoum Capou or Gate
of the Assault.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> If it were the Gate of the Assault, as I also
believe, it was the gate spoken of by contemporaries as Saint
Romanus, and all difficulties as to the place of the general assault,
the position of the stockade defended by Justiniani, and the station
of the great guns vanish.</p>

<p>Thereupon the description of Critobulus makes the arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>ment
of Mahomet’s army clear. His guards were encamped
opposite the Mesoteichion and the Myriandrion&mdash;that is, opposite
the whole length of walls between Top Capou and the Palace of
Porphyrogenitus (ch. xxvi.). His three largest guns were stationed
opposite the Pempton or Military Gate of Romanus, and his
imperial tent was pitched in a place, and at a distance from the
walls, where it could properly be described indifferently as opposite
either the Chariseus or Romanus Gate.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would suggest that the name Top Capou was
given or transferred by the Turks, after the siege and when the
Pempton was walled up, to the Civil Gate of St. Romanus.
There was no need for a name among ordinary people for an unused
gate, and the Turks, instead of using the name of a Christian
saint, spoke of it as that near which the great cannon was placed,
or shortly as Top Capou&mdash;that is, Cannon Gate. It is remarkable
that Gyllius, though mentioning that there was a gate at the
situation of Top Capou, calls it neither by that name nor by that
of St. Romanus.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">580</a></p>

<h2>APPENDIX II</h2>

<p class="center">WHERE DID THE SEA-FIGHT OF APRIL 20, 1453,
TAKE PLACE?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Dr. A. D. Mordtmann,<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> and Dr. Paspates,<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> followed
by M. Mijatovich,<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> and M. E. A. Vlasto,<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> answer, that it was
to the west of the Marmora end of the landward walls: that is,
off Zeitin Bournou. In favour of this view they give the following
reasons:</p>

<p>(1) Because during the fight the sultan rode into the water,
and he could not have done so if the fight had been on the north
shore of the Golden Horn, as the shore there is too steep. The
answer to this is, that the Galata shore four centuries ago was like
that of the Golden Horn outside the walls of Constantinople now,
and consisted of a low flat of mud, now built upon. The present
Grande Rue de Galata is really the ‘Strand’ of Galata, and is
all land reclaimed from the sea. This is even now obvious; but
Gyllius observed the growth of this flat land and gives a curious
description of it.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> This argument therefore fails.</p>

<p>(2) Because Barbaro mentions that the wind dropped when
the ships were ‘per mezo la citade,’ which Dr. Mordtmann considered
to mean halfway along the length of the city between the
end of the landward walls and Seraglio Point, or, as he puts it
definitely, at Vlanga Bostan. But ‘per mezo’ means here simply
alongside or opposite or abreast of the city. It is used as meaning
‘through the midst’ in the same paragraph, when Barbaro states
that he is going from the city on board certain galleys ‘per mezo
la citade.’</p>

<p>It is undisputed that a southerly wind had been blowing four
days: a strong wind which had brought the ships from Chios.
There would therefore be a current running northwards. Consequently
if the wind had suddenly dropped opposite Vlanga
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>Bostan the ships would have drifted toward the Bosporus and not
backwards to Zeitin Bournou.</p>

<p>(3) Because Pusculus says that the townsfolk crowded to the
Hippodrome to see the fight, and they would not have done so
(because buildings intercepted the view) if the fight had been at
the mouth of the Golden Horn.</p>

<p>The Hippodrome is four miles as the crow flies from the sea
opposite Zeitin Bournou, and the spectators would not have
crowded to such a place when they could have seen so much
better from a hill behind Psamatia and elsewhere. If, however,
the fight, or any part of it, took place opposite Seraglio Point,
spectators on the Sphendone of the Hippodrome would have had
an excellent view of the ships as they approached and as they
passed, and of an attack made in the Bosporus before the ships
passed the Acropolis. I have tested this on several occasions.</p>

<p>(4) Because Phrantzes says the fight took place about a stone’s-throw
from the land where the sultan was and that he and his
friends watched it from the walls,<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> and that the only place where
these two requirements can be satisfied is Zeitin Bournou.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Horn satisfies both requirements equally
well. Dr. Paspates observes that ships coming to Constantinople
with a south wind do not keep near the walls, but keep well out;
and the remark is just. They take this course to avoid the eddy
current, which if they kept near the walls would be against them.
If the ships were about a stone’s-throw distant from the land, they
would not only be out of their usual course but taking another
where their progress would be hindered.</p>

<p>(5) Because Ducas (who was not a witness of what he relates)
says that the Turkish fleet set out to wait for the fleet off the
harbour of the Golden Gate.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">587</a></p>

<p>There probably never was a harbour of the Aurea Porta.
Paspates says there was a <i>scala</i> near the Golden Gate, which,
indeed is shown in Bondelmonte’s map, but the ships could not
discharge at an open <i>scala</i> in the Marmora with a south wind
blowing, even if there had been depth enough of water where it
existed, which, at the present day at least, there is not.</p>

<p>The statement of Ducas is improbable, because, as the object of
the ships was to get past the boom from St. Eugenius to Galata,
the ships with the wind which was blowing would have simply
passed the fleet or gone triumphantly through them, if they had
been waiting off the Golden Gate, and have made for Seraglio
Point and the harbour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span></p>

<p>I suggest that the words of Ducas (Χρύση Πύλη) are either an
error in the copying or are a mistake made by Ducas. They may be
a transcriber’s mistake for Horaia Porta&mdash;that is, the gate near
Seraglio Point, on the Golden Horn. Horaia Porta and Aurea
Porta are almost undistinguishable in sound, the aspirate being
unpronounced. The similarity in sound had led at an early period
to confusion.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></p>

<p>It may nevertheless be true that the fleet set out to await the
ships off the end of the landward walls. There is not, however,
the slightest evidence that it ever got there. On the contrary, as
we shall see, the evidence shows that it did not. Once it is
established that it never got so far, the contention that the fight
was off Zeitin Bournou falls.</p>

<p>These are all the arguments which, so far as I know, have
been urged in favour of the Zeitin Bournou position. Some
of them are destructive of the others, and, with the exception of
the statement of Ducas as to the Turkish fleet setting off for the
Harbour of the Golden Gate, are all deductions from the evidence
of the authorities rather than direct evidence. Moreover, as will be
seen, important statements of witnesses testifying to what they
themselves saw are either entirely overlooked or set aside without
any sufficient reason.</p>

<p>My contention in the text is that the fight commenced at the
mouth of the Bosporus off Seraglio Point; that the wind suddenly
dropped while the ships were under the walls of the Acropolis at
that Point; that the ships drifted towards the Galata or Pera
shore, and that the most serious part of the fight took place off
such shore, where it was watched by the sultan and into the
waters of which shore the sultan rode. The evidence in support
of this view is the following:</p>

<p>(1) It is agreed on all sides that the Turkish fleet was stationed
at the Double Columns (Diplokionion).</p>

<p>(2) Leonard the archbishop says that he was a spectator from
the city, and that the sultan was on the slope of the Pera hill.
Leonard is a witness deserving of confidence. He was present
during the whole siege. He had much to do with the people of
Galata, who were, like himself, of the Latin Church. In describing
this particular incident, he speaks of himself as a spectator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>of the fight.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> His letter is an official report addressed to the pope
within three months after the event, and therefore while its details
were fresh in his memory and not like the account of Ducas, who
was not present at the siege and only wrote years afterwards. His
testimony, if he is to be believed&mdash;and I know no reason why he
should even be doubted&mdash;is decisive. ‘The King of the Trojans’
(as he calls the Turks throughout) looked on from Pera hill.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></p>

<p>Le Beau, who took the view which I adopt, relied no doubt
upon Leonard’s narrative in describing the battle. Dr. Mordtmann
remarks upon Le Beau’s statement that no one standing upon the
hillside at Pera could see a fight at sea beyond Seraglio Point.
The observation is correct, and my deduction is that, when the
ships were first attacked, they were abreast of Seraglio Point and
not beyond or behind it. Dr. Mordtmann’s is that the sultan
could not have been at Pera, and this notwithstanding that the
archbishop says that he was there and implies that he saw him
there. The archbishop further mentioned that when the sultan
‘blasphemed,’ as he rode into the water and witnessed the loss his
men were suffering, it was from a hill.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> But the archbishop does
not leave his readers in doubt as to what hill he means. A few
sentences later in his narrative we are told that the sultan had
concluded that he would be able from the eastern shore of the
Galata hill either to sink the ships with his stone cannon-balls, or
at least drive them back from the chain.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> The rest of the passage
shows unmistakably that the sultan, in Leonard’s belief, was on
the shore outside the Galata walls: that is, exactly where a
spectator might be supposed to be who, having come from Diplokionion,
wanted to see the most of a fight in or near the mouth
of the Horn. Unless, therefore, within a short period after the
capture of the city, the archbishop had become hopelessly muddled
as to what he himself saw, we must conclude that the fight did
not take place off Zeitin Bournou but in or near the mouth of the
Golden Horn.</p>

<p>Pusculus, another spectator, says the ships entered the
Bosporus and that the wind dropped while they were under the
walls of the Acropolis. The account given by this writer is clear
and precise. He was in the city and relates what he witnessed,
and although he wrote his poem some years afterwards, when safe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>in his native city of Brescia, he had the broad outlines of the
siege well in his recollection. His narrative is the following,
and is in complete accord with that of every other eye-witness.
The ships are seen approaching on the Marmora; some of the
townsfolk flock to the Hippodrome where (from the Sphendone)
they have a view far and wide over the sea, and can observe them
taking the usual course for ships coming from the Dardanelles
to the capital with a southerly wind. The Turkish admiral with
his fleet has gone to meet them, and orders them to lower their
sails. The south wind still blows full astern, and with bellying
sails they hold on their course. The wind continues until
they are carried to a position where the Bosporus strains against
the shore of either land.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> That is, as I understand the phrase,
until they are at least well past the present lighthouse. ‘There
the wind fails them; the sails flap idly <i>under the walls of the
citadel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> Then, indeed, began the fight; the spirits of the Turks
are aroused by the fall of the wind; Mahomet, watching from the
shore not far off, arouses their rage.’ My only doubt as to this
interpretation arises as to the question whether the writer did not
mean that the wind dropped, not merely off Seraglio Point, but
within the mouth of the Horn.</p>

<p>Ducas says the sultan, when the ships came in sight of the
city, ‘hastened’ to his fleet, and gave orders to capture them or,
failing that, to hinder them from getting inside the harbour. This
hastening of the sultan meant a journey of between two and three
miles from his camp in the Mesoteichion to Diplokionion. Once
he was there, his natural course would be to follow on shore the
movements of his fleet, until he reached the eastern walls of Galata,
which is exactly the place where the archbishop stations him. If
it should be objected that Mahomet’s hastening to his triremes
implies that they were stationed near Zeitin Bournou, the answer
is twofold: first, that there would be no haste necessary, and
secondly, that even Ducas implies that the fleet was in the Bosporus,
as indeed Barbaro and others say that it was.</p>

<p>The two statements of Phrantzes&mdash;first, that the fight was
about a stone’s-throw from the land where the sultan was on
horseback and rode into the sea to revile his men, and, second, that
he (Phrantzes) and his friends watched the fight from the walls<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">595</a>&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>are
both reconcilable with the contention that the fight was where
I have placed it. I conclude that the balance of evidence is in
favour of the opinion that the fight commenced in the open
Bosporus off Seraglio Point, and, the wind continuing, the ships
rounded the Point, and that then the wind dropped, the general
attack took place, and the ships drifted to the Galata shore.</p>

<p>When the question is considered ‘What position accords with
all the accounts of the eye-witnesses?’ there can be only one answer.
The people watch from the Hippodrome, says Pusculus, and
would have a good view until the ships had rounded the point.
The vessels were aiming for Megademetrius, says Ducas: which
was the usual landmark for vessels to steer for when coming to the
Golden Horn from the Marmora with a south wind. ‘We being
spectators’ from the walls and the sultan being on the Pera slope
watching the fight, says Leonard; and the vessels being about a
stone’s-throw from the shore, says Phrantzes. Pusculus answers
the question ‘Where were Leonard and the other spectators?’ by
telling us that the wind dropped under the walls of the citadel.</p>

<p>There is yet another test which may be applied and which
ought almost of itself to settle the question. Upon considering
the position without reference to authorities upon matters of detail
and upon <i>a priori</i> grounds, an unbiassed local investigator would
discard the Zeitin Bournou position and accept that of the
Bosporus-Galata. Four large ships want to enter the Golden Horn,
since there is no harbour on the Marmora side of the city sufficiently
large into which they could enter. They are approaching
with a southerly wind. The Turkish fleet consists of large and small
sailing boats which are stationed nearly two miles from the Horn
in the Bosporus. The object of the fleet is to capture or sink the
ships, or at least to prevent them from entering the harbour. What,
under these circumstances, would the commander of the fleet do?
He would keep his boats well together near the mouth of the Horn
and attempt to bar the passage. He would recognise that he had
little chance of capturing comparatively large sailing vessels on
open sea so long as they were coming on with a wind. So long
as the ships were sailing, they would be attacked at a great
disadvantage. Wait for them near the Horaia Porta, when they
would have to stop, and they could then be fought at an advantage.
If the wind suddenly dropped, the Turkish admiral would
naturally give orders to attack. This is what, as I contend, actually
happened. The fight would then be seen by Greeks from the
walls and by Mahomet and his suite from the Galata or Pera
shore. What would happen when the wind became calm, would
be that the vessels would drift. I repeat what I have said in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
text, that it may be taken as beyond doubt that after a strong
southerly wind has been blowing in the Marmora for four or five
days&mdash;and it was such a wind which had brought the ships from
Chios&mdash;there would be in the Marmora and the Bosporus near
Seraglio Point a strong current setting in the same direction, and
the ships would drift toward the Galata shore. It would then
be quite possible to have got within a stone’s-throw, as Phrantzes
relates, and for their crews to have heard the reproaches of the
sultan.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX III</h2>

<p class="center">NOTE ON TRANSPORT OF MAHOMET’S SHIP.
WHAT WAS THE ROUTE ADOPTED?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> commenting on the story of the transport of Mahomet’s ships
overland from the Bosporus into Cassim Pasha bay, Gibbon says
‘I could wish to contract the distance of ten miles and to prolong
the term of one night.’<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> I have sufficiently remarked in the text
upon the time occupied in the transit. The distances given by the
various authors who describe the incident are confusing, but ten
miles is beyond a doubt wrong.</p>

<p>In order to learn what the distance was, it is necessary to
determine what was the route adopted by Mahomet. Two
routes have been suggested: the first is from Dolma Bagshe,
across the ridge where the Taxim Public Gardens now exist and
down the valley leading to Cassim Pasha; the second, from
Tophana along the valley which the Rue Koumbaraji now occupies,
across the Grande Rue, and down the valley commencing at the
street between the Pera Palace Hotel and the Club to Cassim
Pasha. It is convenient to speak of these routes as those of
Dolma Bagshe and Tophana respectively. No writer who saw
the transport of the ships has described the route. We may
gather evidence, however, on several points which will aid us to
determine it.</p>

<p>The evidence as to the distance traversed is the following.
The archbishop speaks of it as being seventy stadia. I should
agree with Karl Müller, the editor of Critobulus, that the <i>seventy</i>
stadia of Leonard is a clerical error, the figure being intended to
apply to the number of ships, but for the fact that a little later
Leonard speaks of the bridge built over the upper Horn as thirty
stadia long and gives the distance of the Turkish fleet from
the Propontis to its anchorage at the Double Columns as a hundred
stadia. As both these distances are about nine or ten times too
long, it is evident that by ‘stadium’ he means some other measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>than the ordinary stadium, which is 625 feet long, or rather less
than a furlong.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> I therefore suggest that when Leonard speaks of
seventy stadia he makes the difference traversed about eight stadia
as the word is understood by his contemporaries. Critobulus in
describing the overland passage of the boats says they travelled
‘certainly eight stadia’ (στάδιοι μάλιστα ὀκτώ). Probably Critobulus,
writing a few years afterwards and mixing with Turks,
Greeks, and Genoese in Pera itself, would have the best chance of
learning the truth as to the actual road taken. ‘Certainly eight
stadia’ is what an observer who did not wish to exaggerate might
estimate the distance between the present Tophana and Cassim
Pasha to be, and if my suggestion as to Leonard’s measure be
accepted, then the two writers are substantially in accord.
Barbaro gives the distance traversed as three Italian&mdash;equal to two
English&mdash;miles. The evidence as to distance, therefore, is somewhere
between eight stadia and two miles.</p>

<p>The evidence as to the place from which the ships started is
important also. Barbaro states that they left the water at
Diplokionion, a place which he describes as two miles from the
city (say, one and a third English mile), and therefore not so far
as the Double Columns; Ducas, from a place ‘below Diplokionion;’
Pusculus:<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> Columnis haud longe a geminis;’
Phrantzes, ἐκ τοῦ ὄπισθεν μέρους τοῦ Γάλατα: a phrase which certainly does not imply
that the route travelled was so far from the walls of Galata as
Dolma Bagshe is. Chalcondylas and Philelphus<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> say, ‘behind the
hill which overhangs Galata.’</p>

<p>It is interesting to determine where Diplokionion or the
Double Column was. It has usually been considered to be
Beshiktash, and Cantemir so translates it. Professor van
Millingen places it rather in Dolma Bagshe bay&mdash;say, half a mile
south of Beshiktash.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> The late Dr. Dethier says<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> that the present
Cabatash and Tophana were formerly called Diplokionion and
that, as he expresses it, ‘Columnae et incolae emigrarunt post
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>adventum Turcorum in suburbium Beshiktash.’ I am unaware of
his authority for this statement. It appears to me certain that
the Columns were at Dolma Bagshe, which may be called the
southern extremity of Beshiktash. They are so marked in
Bondelmonte’s map made in 1422. It is worth nothing that none
of the authors place the starting-point at the Columns except
Barbaro, and that even he qualifies his statement by explaining
that it was two Italian miles from the city.</p>

<p>Having thus seen the evidence (1) as to the distance travelled
and (2) as to the starting-point, we may ask What was the probable
route? Dr. Paspates in his ‘Poliorkia’<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> discusses the question,
and sensibly remarks that the shortest route would be preferred,
unless there were exceptional difficulties. Now the difficulties by
the Tophana route are decidedly less than by the other. The
distance is less by half than that of the Dolma Bagshe route and
the height to be surmounted is 250 feet against 350. Paspates
suggests the route I have adopted&mdash;namely, from Tophana.
Dr. Mordtmann adopts the Dolma Bagshe route and objects
to that of Tophana because the Turkish ships could have been
seen by the Christian ships at the chain and that these were strong
enough to hinder the undertaking, especially as the sultan had no
batteries on the eastern side to oppose the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">603</a></p>

<p>To this view&mdash;and anything suggested by so careful an observer
as Dr. Mordtmann is deserving of attention&mdash;is to be opposed (1)
that the point of departure adopted by him at Dolma Bagshe could
also be seen from the chain, though of course not so distinctly
as at Tophana; (2) that though there was no battery above
Tophana, there was one above the eastern end of Galata walls, and
probably, as Dethier suggests, very nearly on the site now occupied
by the Crimean Memorial Church; (3) that the height to be
surmounted is lower by nearly a hundred feet than by the Dolma
Bagshe route; (4) that the distance to be traversed is less than
half by the Tophana route than that from Dolma Bagshe; (5) that
it is not by any means clear that the Christian ships could have
hindered the execution of the project, since the Genoese were
absolutely powerless on land outside their own walls. It may,
however, be true, as Ducas asserts, that the Genoese alleged that
they could have stopped the transit if they had wished. But the
allegation, if true, at least implies that they knew what was going
on, and, as mentioned in my text, Mahomet was ready for
opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span></p>

<p>The shortest distance ought to furnish one indication of the
route. The evidence as to what that distance is stated to be
should furnish another, and the starting-point of the expedition a
third. I claim that the eight stadia of Critobulus and the eight or
nine given by Leonard are not greatly at variance with the three
Italian or two English miles of Barbaro, and that from the
evidence of these three witnesses we may say that the distance
travelled was about a mile or a little over. Now the actual
distance by the Tophana route is a little over a mile and ‘certainly
eight stadia.’</p>

<p>The indication gathered from the starting-point is that the
ships left the water well below the Double Columns. But I
submit that there is no place suitable for such an undertaking as
that under consideration between Dolma Bagshe and Tophana.
The indications, therefore, drawn from the place of departure, if
they do not point to the Tophana route, are not at variance with it.</p>

<p>As to the precise place at which the ships arrived on the
Golden Horn Critobulus is probably again the safest guide. They
came to the shore τῶν ψυχρῶν ὑδάτων&mdash;that is, to the Cool Waters,
otherwise called the Springs and now known as Cassim Pasha.
There they were launched into the Golden Horn. The statement
is confirmed incidentally by several authors who mention that the
fleet was opposite a portion of the walls where stands the Spigas
Gate&mdash;that is, the gate leading to the passage across.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> Cassim
Pasha itself was sometimes spoken of as Spigae.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> Andreossi (in
1828) suggests that the ships started from Baltaliman or rather
the bay of Stenia, but the only evidence in favour of this route is
the statement of Ducas&mdash;who more than any other contemporary
is constantly inaccurate&mdash;that they started from the Sacred Mouth
(a name usually employed to designate the north end of the
Bosporus but used by Ducas for the part between Roumelia and
Anatolia-Hissar) and that they reached the harbour opposite the
monastery of St. Cosmas which was outside the landward walls.</p>

<p>Dr. Mordtmann and Professor van Millingen think that the
balance of evidence is in favour of the route from Dolma Bagshe.
The route which Dr. Paspates and Dr. Dethier approved is
that which appears to me also not only the most probable but to
have the balance of evidence in its favour. The tract along which
the ships were hauled formed the short arm of a cross, the long
one of which was the road along the ridge now known as the
Grande Rue de Péra: the two giving the modern Greek name to
the city, of Stavrodromion.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX IV</h2>

<p class="center">THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION ON GREEKS AND MOSLEMS
RESPECTIVELY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> reading the contemporary authors of the period between the
Latin and the Moslem conquests the following questions suggest
themselves: What was the influence of the Orthodox Church
upon the people of the capital and of the empire? What was its
value as a national ethical force? and how did its influence as
such a force compare with that of Islam?</p>

<p>Before attempting a reply to these questions certain facts
must be noted. It must be remembered that the empire was
composed of many races and languages. In the Balkan peninsula
alone there were always at least half a dozen races with as
many different forms of speech. In Asia Minor the component
elements of the population were even still more numerous. The
Church largely aided the State in the endeavour to keep these
divergent elements under the rule of the empire. Her special
task was to change the various races into Christians. But even
when this task was completed to the extent of causing them all
to profess Christianity they retained their racial characteristics
and traditions. These characteristics, though widely various,
may be classified in two categories. In other words, it may be
said that among all the different populations of the empire there
were two streams of tendency: the Hellenic and the Asiatic.
The tendency and influence of each were markedly present in the
church from the first days of the empire and continued until 1453.
Greek influence left an indelible impress upon the Orthodox
Church. But while it influenced the other races of the empire, the
Greeks themselves fell to some extent under the Asiatic influence.
Greek tendency was always to make of Christianity a philosophy
rather than a religion. The opposite tendency, which I have
called Asiatic and which corresponds fairly well to what Matthew
Arnold called Hebraic, had less enduring results upon the population
but was nevertheless constantly present. The two tendencies
were constantly striving one against the other within the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span></p>

<p>Greek influence (1) largely aided in the formation of a philosophical
body of theology, (2) helped to perpetuate paganism
and develop a paganistic tendency, and (3) deprived the Church
of the religious enthusiasm which the Asiatic tendency might
have provided and has often inspired. The service of the Greeks
in reference to the formation of a body of theological philosophy
is too completely recognised to require any notice. Greek influence
helped to perpetuate paganism in various ways. It was
naturally always most powerful in the Balkan peninsula, its chief
centres being Athens and Salonica, but had great weight also in
the western cities of Asia Minor. Greek polytheists in pre-Christian
times were not opposed to the recognition of other gods
than those worshipped by themselves. How this rational toleration,
which was as utterly opposed to the exclusive spirit of
Asiatic Christianity as to that of Islam itself, tended to perpetuate
paganism will be best understood by recalling the early history
of the later Roman empire. The population under the rule of
New Rome had for the most part adopted the profession of
Christianity because it was the religion of the State. Most
people found little difficulty in conforming to the demands of the
emperor and became Christians. Under such circumstances
Christianity did not conquer paganism: it absorbed without
destroying it. Just as in Central Asia many tribes who have
come under the power of Russia have been ordered to elect
whether they would declare themselves Christians or Moslems, so
in the days of the early Christian emperors, and especially under
the laws of Theodosius the choice was between a profession of the
Court creed or remaining in some form of paganism where its professors
would be subject to various disabilities and persecutions.
The conformity which resulted was curious. The people became
nominally Christians, but they brought with them into the Church
most of their old superstitions. Their ancient deities were not
discarded but were either secretly worshipped or came to be
regarded as Christian saints: their festal days became the commemoration
days of Christian events. I do not forget that something
of the same kind went on in the Western Church and that
the missionaries, finding themselves unable to persuade their converts
to abandon their old observances, deftly adopted them into
the Christian Church. But all that was done in this direction in
the West was small in comparison with what went on in the East.
St. George took the place of Apollo. St. Nicholas replaced
Poseidon. The highest hill in every neighbourhood on the
mainland and in every island of the Marmora and the Aegean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
had fittingly been crowned with a temple dedicated to the God of
Day. The great dragon, Night, had been overcome by Helios.
To this day it is almost universally true that all the peaks in
question have an Orthodox church which has taken the place of
the temple of Apollo and is dedicated to his successor, St. George.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">606</a>
In like manner the temples built in fishing villages to Poseidon
have almost invariably been dedicated to St. Nicholas. The
episcopal staff of a Greek bishop has the two serpents’ heads
associated with Aesculapius. The distribution of holy bread at
funerals, the processions to shrines, to sacred groves, to Hagiasmas
or holy wells, and numerous other customs of the Orthodox
Church, are survivals or rudimentary forms of paganism.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">607</a></p>

<p>Asiatic influence was more powerful in Constantinople than in
Greece. The explanation of this fact is to be found in the remoteness
of Athens from the capital; in the greater intellectual life of
Constantinople; in the presence of many leaders of thought from
the cities in Asia Minor under Asiatic influence, and in the
traditional Roman sentiment derived from the influence of Latin
rulers, literature, and tradition. The iconoclastic movement
towards the end of the eighth century was a genuine attempt to
get rid of pagan practices. It failed because of the base character
of some of its imperial supporters, because of the opposition of the
less cultured western church, and because the Empress Irene, a
native of Athens and brought up among the traditions of paganism
which still lived on in what was then a remote part of the empire,
placed herself at the head of the Hellenic party and with her strong
will was able to prevent any reformation being accomplished.</p>

<p>But paganism in Greece and Asia Minor lived on long after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>time of Irene. The Hellenistic influence struggled hard against
the Asiatic or what was not unfitly called the Roman party. When
we come to the last century of the empire’s history, we find its
influence triumphant, and this to such an extent that we see
Plethon and his school, as the representatives of a phase of Greek
thought, dreaming of the restoration of paganism. I conclude,
therefore, that Greek influence helped to perpetuate paganism or
at least a paganistic tendency.</p>

<p>Greek influence deprived the Church of the religious enthusiasm
which the study of the Old Testament has often inspired. It
must always be remembered that the Greeks had the New
Testament in a language they could understand. Every one
recognises that a large part of the intellectual movement in
England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was due
to the translation of the sacred Scriptures into the vernacular.
But there has been no period in the history of the Greek race
since the compilation of the Christian record in which the Greeks
have not had the advantage of a familiarity with the Gospels and
the writings of St. Paul. They knew the New Testament well.
Its Greek was colloquial. But they were less familiar with the
Old Testament. Although frequent allusions are made to the
stories in the older book by many writers during the later centuries
of the Church’s history, the Septuagint was written in a
language less understood by the people. Indications that the Old
Testament influenced men’s conduct are lacking, and point either
to a want of familiarity with it, or to some other cause which
made its influence less than that which it has had on other peoples.
The passionate zeal of our own Puritans, with their application of
Jewish history to English politics; the political principles of the
defenders of civil liberty in America; the fierce enthusiasm of the
Scotch Covenanters, of the Dutch Protestants, and of the Boers,
were all derived from the Old rather than from the New Testament.
The influence of the more ancient book might have been
great upon the Asiatic party if its writings had been as familiar
as those of the New Testament. As it was, though its influence
was undoubtedly felt, that derived from the New Testament
became more powerful as the centuries went on, ultimately
triumphed, and led to results which assist us to furnish an answer
to the questions under examination.</p>

<p>What, then, was the general effect of the double stream of
influence on the members of the Orthodox Church? The familiarity
of the subjects of the empire with the text of the New
Testament combined with the intellectual genius of the Greek race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
led them to take a delight in the study of the philosophical
questions which the New Testament, and especially the writings of
St. Paul, suggest. To take a keen interest in any metaphysical
study is for any people a gain, and it is none the less so when the
subject is theology. Now the interest of the population in
theological questions was at all times absorbing.</p>

<p>When these questions were settled by the Church, the Asiatic
influence made itself felt and produced a conservatism, a stubborn
refusal to change or abandon any position, which the more fickle-minded
or philosophical Greek could never have displayed. Each
of the two tendencies exerted its influence upon the conduct of the
Orthodox Church. Speaking generally, we may say that all its
members were devotedly attached to their faith&mdash;or perhaps it
would be more exact to say, to their creeds. Of political questions
in the modern sense they knew little. In their ignorance of
foreign nations, questions of external policy hardly interested them,
but the intellectual life of the country&mdash;mostly confined to the
great cities, to Nicaea, Salonica, Smyrna, and above all the capital&mdash;was
fully awake to theological questions. While ready to discuss,
they maintained every dogma and every article with a persistence
which increased as the years rolled on. They took a keen interest
in any question whenever any heretic appeared who attempted to
throw doubt on what the Church had decided. They were ready
to die for their faith.</p>

<p>The writers of the Greek Church show by abundant examples
that they and the people believed in the existence of a God who
lives and rules the world and the conduct of individuals. Their
very superstitions afford sufficient evidence of such a belief. He
was an avenging God. Black Death and Plague are described as
the instruments of His vengeance. Omens and signs in a variety
of forms were the means by which He, or some of the Hierarchy of
Heaven, intimated to the faithful what was about to happen.
The absence of omens was a sign of His displeasure or His
abandonment of their cause.</p>

<p>The men who discussed the religious questions which arose
during the later as well as the earlier centuries of the empire
regarded them as tremendous realities. The discussions were not
mere exchange of opinions or formulating of phrases: not mere
academical disputations, among the learned of the time, of metaphysical
abstractions, but were often careful attempts to solve the
insoluble. The results were of supreme importance. If you
believed aright, you would be saved. If you disbelieved or
believed wrongfully, you would be damned in the next world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
and, as far as the believers could accomplish it, in this also.
Unless the eagerness, the passion, the deadly Asiatic earnestness
of the religious discussions or wranglings be realised, no true
conception can be formed of fourteenth and fifteenth century life
in Constantinople.</p>

<p>Contemporary writers supply abundant and indisputable
evidence that, from the patriarch downwards, the members of the
Greek Church attached overwhelming importance to the correctness
of their orthodoxy. The utmost care about correct definitions
was taken by the Church to check paganism. The miscreant was
a worse offender than the man who disregarded the ordinary laws
of morality. Souls were to be saved by right belief. As in the
Western Church, whosoever would be saved, it was necessary before
all things that he should accept the right formulas. But the
Eastern gave greater prominence to the formulas than even the
Western. While the Roman Church attached most importance to
its Catholicity and to the necessity of propagating the faith, the
Greek Church always prided itself rather on its Orthodoxy. If the
question were whether the empire was Christian, and if the test of
being a Christian nation were the jealous guardianship of every
dogma in the precise manner that it had been formulated by the
Councils of the Church, then the Orthodox Church, to which the
inhabitants of the capital and empire belonged, would take a very
high rank among Christian nations.</p>

<p>It is not possible to doubt that the keen interest taken in the
discussion of religious questions quickened the intellectual
development of the population, and in this respect the influence of
the Church was purely beneficial. To suggest, as did the historians
of the eighteenth century, that the Greeks were at once profoundly
theological and profoundly vile is not only to ask that an indictment
should be framed against a whole people, but is contrary to
general experience and to fact. In spite of the occasional conjunction
of theology and immorality in the same individual, the
nation which takes a lively interest in the former is not likely to be
addicted to the latter.</p>

<p>A strong and, I think, an unanswerable case might be made
out to show that the religion of the Orthodox Church beneficially
influenced the conduct of men and women in their individual
capacity and in their relations one with another. All believed in
the doctrine of eternal punishment and in the divine gifts granted
to the Church by which punishment might be avoided. In their
constant efforts to take advantage of the graces at the disposal of
the Church, and in their endeavours to attain the ideal of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
philosophy, men and women were led by their religion to be more
moral, more honest, and more kindly one to another, than they would
otherwise have been. The denunciations of those who had been
guilty of unclean conduct, and the constant praise of almsgiving,
lead to the conclusion that the Church had so far exercised
influence for good. It had given the citizens of the empire a
higher standard of family and social life. The very stubbornness
which the Asiatic tendency supplied, and which led all to resist
every attempt to change the formulas of the faith, came in itself
to stand the population in good stead after 1453. Their wranglings
on religious questions helped to form a public opinion which
prevented any considerable number of Christians from abandoning
their religion. We may safely conclude, therefore, that the
Orthodox Church had aided in developing intellectual life, in
raising and maintaining a high tone of morality, and in so attaching
its members to their religion that when the time of trial came they
remained faithful. It had done more. While accomplishing
these objects it had raised a whole series of heterogeneous races to
a higher level of civilisation and had largely contributed to make
the empire the foremost and best educated state in Europe. It
had checked the Greek tendency to attachment merely to the city
or province and had made patriotism and brotherhood words of
wider signification than they possessed in Greece.</p>

<p>It is when we pass from the influence of the Church on the
conduct of the individual, to ask what was the value of its
ethical teaching in regard to national life, whether it ever set
before the nation a lofty national ideal, or whether it ever caused
a wave of religious enthusiasm which influenced the nation as a
whole, that we find the Orthodox Church during the later centuries
of its history greatly lacking. Religion was to guide the conduct
of the individual and to save him from eternal punishment.
There was little or no conception of it as an aid to national
righteousness. There was no inspiration for national action, such
as a study of the Old Testament has often supplied. There was
never any great religious fervour for the accomplishment of an
object because it was believed to be the divine will. I am not
thinking of such religious enthusiasm as led to the abolition of the
slave trade or of slavery, to the temperance movement or to that
for the diminution of crime and the reform of criminals or for the
bettering the condition of the labouring classes and the like.
These are social developments belonging to later years, which
may be credited, in part at least, to the account of Christianity.
It is in the contemporary religious movements of other portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
of the Christian world that the measure of the national religious
life of the empire must be taken. The series of Crusades enables
a comparison of this kind to be fairly made, though other standards
of comparison suggest themselves. The empire under the rule of
Constantinople had a greater interest in checking the progress of
the Moslems in Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor than had the
Western nations. But in the whole course of Byzantine history,
though the empire steadily resisted the Mahometan armies, there
was no display of religious enthusiasm to lend its aid at any time
comparable with that which was shown in the West. An
Eastern Peter the Hermit could not have aroused the members of
the Orthodox Church. No Godfrey de Bouillon could have found
statesmen in the East to have espoused his cause. If leaders
had been forthcoming, followers would have been wanting.
Though the statesmen of the West were influenced by many
motives to join in the Crusades, they, too, were largely under the
sway of religious fervour. The nations of which they were the
leaders did display such fervour for the accomplishment of objects
which were believed to be in conformity with the divine will. As
for the great mass of crusaders, it cannot be doubted that they
took the cross mainly because they believed that they were doing
the will of God. Absence of precaution, deficiency of organisation,
unreasoning fanatical zeal, unreasonable and senseless haste to
come into conflict with the infidel, the army of child crusaders, the
sacrifices men made of their property, most of the incidents, indeed,
which make up the narratives of the Crusades, show that the
Soldiers of the Cross were steeped in religious fervour, and were
in a condition of pious exaltation. They were, as they called
themselves, an army of God. They were willing to face any
danger, and to go to certain death for their Master’s cause.</p>

<p>The Greek was always ready to defend a dogma. He entertained
a profound dislike and contempt for Christian heretics who
were usually less well informed than he and were generally
fanatically in earnest, but he was more tolerant of heresy than
the men of the West, who in the Middle Ages bestowed on heretics
a fanatical hatred and contempt greater even than that felt towards
the infidel, and like that entertained in the present day towards
anarchists as enemies of the human race.</p>

<p>No cause ever presented itself to the Greek as capable of
arousing such fervour as the soldiers of the West displayed.
Religion having become a New Testament philosophy, and the
Old Testament inspiration in national life having been lost, there
was little care for its propagation. The missionary age of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
Orthodox Church in the empire, as soon as the Hellenic influence
triumphed over the Asiatic, had passed away. Since the days of
Cyril and Methodius, the great apostles of the ninth century, the
Church could show few conversions and few serious attempts at
conversion. That the Church should be orthodox was apparently
enough. There was no attempt to enlarge its area. Christianity
appeared to be regarded by one party as the best system of
philosophy, and by the other, much as the Jew regarded his
religion, as a sacred treasure to be kept for his own use and not to
be offered to outside unbelievers. His religion in the later centuries
never really moved the Greek to engage in missions. Except in
regard to personal conduct, to almsgiving, kindness to his fellow-members
of the Orthodox Church, and personal and commercial
morality, he was incapable of religious sentiment. Something due
to his race, something to his traditions, and something to his
theological training, made Christianity, except as a philosophical
system, sit lightly upon him and failed to make it a powerful
national force. Then, as now, the Greek members of the Orthodox
Church could not sympathise with or even comprehend the
religious sentiment which has led the men of the West, whether
acknowledging the jurisdiction of Rome or not, to undertake
great movements, or even war, in defence of an object whose only
recommendation was that it had right on its side.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that in the empire and throughout Asia
Minor nationality and religion were, as indeed they are to this
day, always confounded or regarded as synonymous terms, Orthodox
Christianity was unable to add a powerful religious sentiment
to the defence of the empire. As a force inducing them to resist
the encroachments of Islam, like that which influenced our
fathers against Spain or the Ironsides against Charles, I doubt
whether it was ever of much value. We have seen a patriarch
writing apparently with great satisfaction that the Church was
allowed to retain its liberty under Turkish rule. Throughout
the long centuries of struggle against Islam, there were many
Christians who transferred themselves to the jurisdiction of the
sultans in order that they might live in peace. The individual
aspect of Christianity was regarded, not the national.</p>

<p>It is when the influence of the Church upon the spirit of the
population of the empire is compared with that of Mahometanism
upon the Turkish hordes that its weakness as a dynamic force is
most plainly seen. Mahometanism, like Christianity in Western
lands and in Russia, is a missionary faith. Islam as a fighter’s
religion, with its fatalism, its rewards of the most sensual pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
that a barbarian is capable of conceiving, and its ennobling teaching
that fighting the battles of the faith is fighting for God, has produced
the most terrible armies that have ever come out from among any
of the races among which its converts have been made. Islam
in the twentieth century has spent much of its original force,
because doubt as to its divine origin has entered into the hearts of
its ablest members. Those among them who have seen or have
otherwise learned the results of Christian civilisation instinctively
and almost unconsciously judge the two religions by their fruits.
Such men either become entirely neglectful of the ceremonious
duties which their religion imposes, or, if they profess to have
become more intent in their religious convictions than before,
perform their ceremonies with a sub-consciousness that their
religion is not better than that of the unbelievers. In whichever
category they fall they lose their belief in the exclusively divine
character of their creed. Nor do the studies in astronomy, medicine,
geology, and other modern sciences fail to implant a similar
and even a greater amount of scepticism in the Mahometan than
they have done in the Christian mind. While visits to foreign
countries and scientific studies are undertaken by few, their influence
as a leaven is great.</p>

<p>In the centuries preceding the Moslem conquest of Constantinople
scepticism was absent among both the Christian and
Mahometan masses. The Ottoman Turks in the fifteenth century,
more perhaps than at any other time, were full of the zeal of new
converts. They were in a period of conquest which stimulated them.
Many, perhaps most of them, believed in their divine mission.
They were the chosen people, whose duty it was to give idolaters
the choice of conversion to the one true faith or of death, to
subdue all nations who accepted either the Old or the New Testament
but refused to accept the prophethood of Mahomet, and to
treat them as rayahs or cattle. Their spiritual pride caused them
to think of those who professed any form of Christianity as
being inferior and divinely predestined to occupy a hopelessly
lower plane, as having only the privilege that their lives should be
spared so long as they paid tribute and accepted subjection. Their
central, overpowering belief was that they had a mission from
God and the Prophet, and the result of such belief was fearlessness
of danger. It was their duty to kill idolaters and subjugate
Christians. Whatever happened to them in the fulfilment of this
duty was not their business but God’s. He would bring about
the predestined victory or the temporary defeat; but in either
case it was well with them. If they lived, the plunder of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
enemies was their reward; if they died, then heaven and the
houris.</p>

<p>When this attitude of mind is compared with that which
existed among the members of the Orthodox Church, we see at
once great divergences between the two forms of faith as national
ethical forces. On the one hand, the student of comparative
religions must give that Church credit for having aided the
growth of the population in the Christian virtues, for having
given them an inspiration enabling them to suffer and to hope, for
having preserved learning, developed national intelligence, cultivated
exact thought, for having promoted philosophical studies and
in various ways guarded the treasures of classic times until the rest
of Europe was ready to receive them. On the other hand, such
student, while recognising that Mahometanism prevents progress
by assigning an inferior position to woman, by inculcating a spirit
of fatalism which mischievously affects almost every act of the
believer’s life and keeps the Turkish race in poverty, and by presenting
a lower ideal of life, will have to admit that its influence
as a religious force, with its ever-present sense of a Supreme
Power, omnipotent to save or to destroy, was far greater than
that of the Orthodox Church, and that the Church failed to supply
the stimulus of a national inspiration comparable with that of the
hostile creed, or with that furnished by Christianity to the men of
the West.</p>

‘Pachymeres ragt durch seine Bildung und litterarische Thätigkeit über seine
Zeitgenossen empor und kann als der grösste byzantinische Polyhistor des 13.
Jahrhunderts bezeichnet werden. In ihm erblickt man deutlich die Licht- und
Schattenseiten des Zeitalters der Paläologen. Es fehlt dem Pachymeres nicht
an Gelehrsamkeit, Originalität und Witz.’ <i>Geschichte der Byzantinischen
Litteratur</i>, p. 289. Pachymer was himself a Greek, born in Nicaea but a
member of the Latin Church. He deals with the doings of the emperor and
the Greek ecclesiastics in a fair spirit. His History is essentially that of his
own times and covers the period from 1261 to 1308.</p></div>

and there is no reason to believe that any but a very small portion of them
would think it a religious duty to fight against the Czar at the bidding of the
Sultan. It should also not be forgotten that the majority of them are Shiahs,
who have never shown any disposition to aid the Sunnis, who acknowledge the

(iv. 8). Dr. Mordtmann, who is not merely distinguished as an archæologist

corrective. Krumbacher in his account of Byzantine literature speaks of
Gregoras as ‘die Hauptperson des 14. Jahrhunderts’ (p. 19). His narrative is
described by Cantacuzenus as stamped with ignorance, partiality, and falsehood.
Its chief accusation against him is not merely false but improbable
(iv. 24). In his own History Cantacuzenus declares that he has never
departed from the truth either on account of hatred or the desire to say
pleasant things (iv. concluding chapter). What he finds most fault with in
Gregoras is the statement that, even during the lifetime of Andronicus, Cantacuzenus
had become possessed of a burning desire to become emperor, and
that he had consulted certain monks at Mount Athos who were supposed to
have the power of divination, in order to learn whether he would accomplish
his desire. The story, he declares, is absolutely false. It is brought up because
he as emperor protected Palamas in his religious controversies where Gregoras
took the opposite side.</p></div>

the doctrines in which, according to their enemies, they believed. Apparently
they were quietists, searchers after the Inner Light, who would have nothing
to do with the worship of Eikons, were possibly Unitarians, and had a tendency
in many directions towards what may be called reformation principles. Their
teaching was imbued with the Slavic mysticism which is characteristic to-day
of Russian literature.
</p>
<p>
The Bogomils became first noticeable in Bulgaria in the days of King
Peter (927–968). Even a few years earlier they are alluded to as certain
‘Pagan Slavs and Manichaeans.’ Later on the Bogomils are spoken of as
Paulicians. In Bosnia they became so powerful that the whole country was
described as Bogomil. The pope in 1407 promised help to Sigismund against
the ‘Manichaeans and Arians’ in Bosnia, and they were beaten and the
kingdom dismembered in 1410–11. The Council of Bâle received a deputation
from the Bogomils in 1435 and dealt at the same time with them and with the
Hussites. In 1443 they lent valuable aid to Hunyadi against the Turks.
Persecuted by both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, many of the magnates
who had been forced to become Catholics in order to retain their lands turned
Mahometans, and their example was largely followed by the smaller landholders.
Among the Mahometans of Bosnia there still exist many customs of Christian
origin. Mr. Evans, in <i>Through Bosnia and Herzegovina</i>, states that there
are still many thousands of Bogomils in these countries. Herr Asboth, who
has been over the country, declares the statement to be too general, and says
that he was never able to find any, although he admits that they recently
existed. Subject in Bulgaria to persecution from the Orthodox Church, many
of them sought escape about a century ago by joining the Church of Rome.
Bogomilism spread from Bosnia into Europe, where it gave rise to the Cathari
or Albigenses, who acknowledged the Church of Dragovitza in Macedonia as
their mother Church. The best account I know of the Bogomils in Bosnia is
in J. de Asboth’s <i>Official Tour through Bosnia and Herzegovina</i>, London,
1900.</p></div>

The expression ‘fossilised aversion’ is perhaps too strong, though I should
be prepared to admit that the Eastern <i>non possumus</i> was at least as obstinate as
the Western. The Orthodox Church in countries where it is free, as in Greece

‘fossilised.’ Since 1453 in Turkey it has been comatose.</p></div>

employed by the Turks after the capture of Constantinople, had probably been
used by them for many centuries previously. It is true that it had been made
use of in Constantinople at an early period, and figures on several coins of
Constantine, but I doubt whether it was used as the symbol of Constantinople
in the later centuries of its history. The Crusades are not incorrectly described
as wars between the Cross and the Crescent. The symbol is an ancient one
and figures with the star on several coins belonging to about 200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The

mistake. It arises from the misinterpretation of the Turkish word <i>Kafés</i>, which
has the two significations given above. Two contemporary authors made the
blunder, Phrantzes and Arab Schah. A Bavarian, who was made prisoner at
the battle of Nicopolis, named Schildberger, and who was present at the battle
of Angora, has given a detailed account of the massacre of the Christians, but
he does not mention the cage. (His travels between 1394 and 1427 have been
translated and published by the Hakluyt Society, 1879.) Neither do Ducas,
Chalcondylas, or Boucicaut, though they state that Bajazed died in irons,
which he had to wear every night after his attempt at escape. Six Persian
authors who wrote the history of Timour are silent about the cage. The oldest
Turkish historian recounts, upon the evidence of an eye-witness, that Bajazed
was carried about in a palanquin ‘like a Kafés,’ or in the usual kind of grilled
palanquin in which ladies of the harem travelled. Sad-ud-din, one of the most
exact of Turkish historians, states that the story of the iron cage given by many
Turkish writers is a pure invention.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_144_144" id="Footnote_144_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144_144"><span class="label">144</span></a> The Turkish accounts agree that the crossing was at the Bosporus.
Barletius, Book II. p. 38, with whom Leunclavius agrees, says: ‘Si vera est
fama,’ merchant vessels transported the army over the Bosporus, receiving a
gold coin per man. Bonfinius likewise gives this story of payment and says
it was made to the Genoese. Lonicerus, p. 18, says the fleet crossed the Dardanelles.
Ducas, whose account I have adopted, states that the fleet only
crossed with great difficulty and against the will of the emperor. Chalcondylas
makes the transit take place at Hieron, near the Dardanelles (Chalc. 135);
one writer, at Asomaton. There is a church of the Asomatoi (the Bodiless,
<i>i.e.</i> of Angels) at Arnaoutkeui still existing. See <i>The Constantiade</i>, where
the Patriarch gives an account of it. Phrantzes identifies the position on
the Bosporus (namely, opposite Anatolia-Hissar) by saying that it was near
the narrow part of the Bosporus above the village of Asomaton or Arnaoutkeui:
κατὰ τὸ στενὸν ἐγγὺς τοῦ ἀνωτέρου μέρους τῆς τῶν
Ἀσωμάτων κώμης (Ph. ch. II. p. 223), which is conclusive as to the locality he wishes to indicate. Ducas
also in several places gives the name of Hieron to the straits between Anatolia
and Roumelia-Hissar. It is therefore clear that two places on the Bosporus were
known as Hieron. The safest passage would be at the Hieron below the Giant’s
Mountain.</p></div>

dervishes after Varna, though on other matters regarding his life he relies
upon Cantemir, who by implication discredits the story. Chalcondylas states
that in the crisis of the battle of Varna, the sultan had vowed that if he were
successful he would abdicate and join one of these religious orders. Von Hammer
knows nothing of the story, and the whole course of Murad’s life is against the
belief that ‘the lord of nations submitted to fast and pray and turn round in
endless rotations with the fanatics who mistook the giddiness of the head for
the illumination of the Spirit’ (Gibbon, VII. p. 140). Neither Phrantzes nor
Ducas mentions his having become a dervish, as they probably would have done
if the fact had been known to them. Indeed, the one point in favour of the
story was unknown to Gibbon: namely, that some of the dervish sects are
liberal or philosophical. They are all religious or pietistic, but many claim
that their tenets are independent of Islam. Their explanation of the turning
or dancing is that they first look towards Mecca and reflect, God is there;
then they make a turn and reflect, He is there also; and so in the complete circle.
It should be noted also that there are many dervishes who neither turn nor
dance in their devotions. On the subject of the dervishes in Turkey, two
useful books are <i>The Dervishes</i>, by J. P. Brown (London, 1868), and, better
still, <i>Les Confréries Musulmanes</i> par le R. P. Louis Petit, supérieur des

take possession of the chain or to drive away the defending fleet tends to show
that the Greek fleet was respectable in number of ships. On the other hand,
when it became of extreme importance to send ships outside the chain to aid
ships from Genoa coming to the relief of the city, the fact that none were sent
out is evidence to show that no ships could be spared from the defence of the
chain or that no sufficient number of galleys, triremes, or other vessels independent
of wind for propulsion were at hand to take the offensive. There were

the barrel of which was forty spans or twenty-six feet eight inches
long. The bronze of which it was cast was eight inches in thickness in the
barrel. Throughout half the length its bore was of a diameter of thirty inches.
Throughout the other half, which contained powder, the bore was only
one third of that width. The σπιθαμὴ or <i>palmus</i> or span was in the Middle
Ages, says Du Cange, eight inches long. Two stone balls still existing at Top-Hana
(that is, the Cannon Khan) are forty-six inches in diameter. These would
answer the description of Tetaldi, that the ball reached to his waist. A great
Turkish cannon which is now in the Artillery Museum at Woolwich weighs
about nineteen tons. It was cast fifteen years after the siege of Constantinople
and is an excellent specimen of the great cannon of the period (<i>Artillery; its
Progress and Present Stage</i>, by Commander Lloyd and A. G. Hadcock, R.E.,

it is difficult to credit Dethier’s statement.</p></div>

like the French soldier Tetaldi and the Venetian Barbaro, are not far apart.
The first says there were 16 to 18 galleys, the second 12. The estimate of the
long boats is 60 to 80 by Tetaldi, as against 70 to 80 by Barbaro; while the
transport barges or parandaria are described by one as from 16 to 20, by the
other as from 20 to 25. Chalcondylas (p. 158) states that 30 triremes and 200

spoken of as the St. Romanus Gate. The Italians, who had the largest share
in the defence in the Lycus valley, probably ignorant of any name for the
Military Gate which led from the city into the peribolos, called it by the name
of the nearest Civil Gate. Hence I propose to speak of the Pempton as the
Romanus Gate and of the Civil Gate crowning the seventh hill by its present
Turkish name of Top Capou&mdash;that is, Cannon Gate&mdash;a name which it probably
acquired by a reversal of the process which had led the Italians to speak of the
Pempton as St. Romanus.</p></div>

complain that the Greeks showed a want of patriotism in not being ready to
give all their wealth for the defence of the empire. But the complaint is supported
by very slight evidence. The Superior of the Franciscans (Dethier’s <i>Siege
of Constantinople</i>, p. 490) says that the city was lost through the avarice of the
Greeks, because they would not consent to pay its defenders. He instances
the case of a woman who had jewels and money of the value of 150,000 ducats,
and of a man whose wealth in moveables amounted to 80,000 ducats. Jagarus
and Neophytus, who are mentioned by Leonard, had been charged with the
repairs of the walls, for which money had been given them, but, according to
him, had misappropriated it. When the city was captured, 70,000 gold pieces
were discovered by the Turks. But it is noteworthy that Phrantzes, who was
in a better condition to know the truth in such a matter, has nothing but praise
for Jagarus (p. 225). The statement of Leonard regarding them is examined
by Dethier, who suggests that the sentence regarding the finding of the coin is
due to the incorporation of a marginal note. Zorzo Dolfin, whose narrative is
largely copied from Leonard, gives a somewhat different version.
</p>
<p>
As stated on the preceding page, the inscriptions on the Outer Wall still show
that many towers had been repaired in the interval between Murad’s siege and
that of Mahomet, and two inscriptions at least, which may perhaps be taken as
intended to apply to all the towers so repaired, bear the name of Jagarus himself.

it highly probable that in 1453 the whole of what is now the main street of
Galata from the bridge to Tophana was under water.</p></div>

selected for this overland transit. Barbaro says, ‘le qual fusti si iera de banchi
quindexe fina banchi vinti et anchi vintido’ (page 28). This would agree fairly
well with the statement of Chalcondylas, that some had thirty and some fifty
oars. Mr. Cecil Torr calculates that a thirty-oared ship would be about
seventy feet long, a statement which appears probable (<i>Ancient Ships</i>, p. 21).
The mediaeval galleys and other large vessels propelled by oars differed
essentially from those of the sixteenth century, which were worked with long
oars. See note on p. <a href="#Page_234">234</a>. I am myself not entirely satisfied that among the
boats were not biremes and possibly triremes in the sense of boats which had
two or three tiers of oars, one above the other. Fashions change slowly in
Turkey, and I have seen a bireme with two such tiers of oars on the Bosporus.
No writer mentions the length of the vessels which were carried across Pera
Hill. A large modern fishing caique in the Marmora, probably not differing
much in shape from the fustae then transported, and containing twelve oars,
measures about fifty feet long. When the boats are longer, two men take one
oar, but this is very unusual. Leonard speaks of the seventy vessels as
biremes. Barbaro calls them fustae. The former was probably the best Latin
word to signify the new form of vessel. Many of the ships were large, though
it may be taken as certain that none were of the length of the two galleys
recently raised in lake Nemi, near Rome, which belonged to Caligula, each
of which is 225 feet long and 60 feet beam.</p></div>

each barrel, including a space between them, to be four feet, this would give the
length of the bridge as 2,000 feet, which is about the width of the Horn at the
place mentioned. Phrantzes gives its length at a hundred fathoms and the
breadth fifty fathoms. These dimensions are clearly wrong if applied to the
bridge, since the length falls far short of the width of the gulf. Leonard says
it was thirty stadia long. Here, as elsewhere, I suspect that he uses stadium
for some measure about one ninth of a furlong in length. If this conjecture
is right, his estimate of the length of the bridge is about 2,000 feet.</p></div>

the translator of the Moscovite. Chalcondylas calls it <i>helepolis</i>, distinguishing
it from the cannon which he names <i>teleboles</i>. Ducas speaks of cannon usually
by the word χωνείαν, sometimes as τὰς πετροβολιμαίους χώνας or σκευαὶ πετροβόλοι
or simply as τὸ σκεῦος; Phrantzes employs the word <i>helepolis</i> for a
wooden turret (pp. 237, 244). The latter word is used by Critobulus for a cannon.
It was an epithet applied to Helen, ‘the Taker of Cities.’ In the Bonn edition
of Phrantzes it is also employed, both in the text and the Latin translation, for
cannon; but a reference to the readings of the Paris MS. suggests that it is an
error. Phrantzes’s words for cannons are <i>teleboles</i> and <i>petroboles</i>.</p></div>

with San Romano to the Pempton. Elsewhere he uses Cresca for the Golden
Gate (<i>e.g.</i> p. 18). Possibly, however, he is referring to another turret, which was
at the Golden Gate. Barbaro’s knowledge of places and names is not accurate.
If Barbaro’s ‘bastion’ is the ‘helepole’ of which Phrantzes speaks (p. 245), then
the three writers agree that the principal turret was at the Romanus Gate.</p></div>

somewhat conflicting. Perhaps here also Critobulus is the safest guide. In
chapter xlvi. he mentions the religious procession already described, where the
statue of the Virgin falls, and says it was ‘three or four days before the attack.’
Immediately after came torrential rains with vivid flashes of lightning. Then,
‘the next day,’ there was a thick fog lasting till evening. Barbaro speaks of a
darkness, due, judging from his description, to an eclipse of the moon, lasting
from the first to the sixth hour after sunset, as being on the 22nd. This
alarmed the Greeks, he says, because of an ancient prophecy which declared
that Constantinople should not be lost until the moon should give a sign in the
heavens. Phrantzes (page 264) says: φῶς ἀστράπτον καταβαῖνον ἐξ οὐρανῶν καὶ δι’ ὅλης τῆς νυκτὸς ἄνωθεν τῆς
πόλεως ἑστὸς διέσκεπεν αὐτήν. Possibly both
Phrantzes and Barbaro have the same atmospheric night effects in view: that
is, that there were frequent flashes of lightning during the night so long as the
eclipse lasted. The statement of Pusculus, who was in the city at the time, has
already been quoted. See p. <a href="#Page_297">297</a>, <i>ante</i>. The account of Critobulus appears
clear, but it does not eliminate the miraculous, for he declares that many
persons, both Romans and foreigners, declared that they had seen the Divinity
hiding Himself in the clouds.</p></div>

Turkish council concludes by stating that this was on the 27th&mdash;that is, Sunday
(p. 269). It may have been, but it is difficult to believe that the council
meeting, the sending of Zagan to learn the opinion of the soldiers, his return
and the decision, together with the subsequent proclamation, were all crowded
into one day. Barbaro gives the proclamation as being made on Monday the
28th. Leonard says that, as a result of the meeting, a proclamation was issued
for the attack to be on Tuesday and for the three preceding days to be devoted
to prayer and one of them to fasting. If he is correct, the council could not
have been on the 27th. Tetaldi states that the council lasted during four days.
The statement appears possible, and perhaps gives the explanation of the
apparent discrepancies in the narratives.</p></div>

delivered? The answer I am disposed to give is that a speech was delivered
which was substantially that reported by Phrantzes and Critobulus. The
fashion followed by the Byzantine writers, and their desire to imitate classical
models, by putting all speeches in the first person, made it necessary to invent a
speech if the substance of what was said were known. Critobulus, writing some
years after the capture and having had many opportunities of meeting with the
Turkish leaders, was in a position to learn what was said and done by them,
and hence his report, wherever it can be tested, almost invariably proves trustworthy.</p></div>

According to Ducas, Mahomet commenced on the Sunday evening to make
a general attack and during the night the besieged were not permitted to sleep
but were harassed all night and, though in a less active manner, until between
four and five of the afternoon of Monday. Phrantzes declares the capture to
have been made on the third day of the attack and would thus make it begin
on Sunday, but his narrative shows that the general attack began after midnight
of the 28–9th. Barbaro’s statement substantially agrees with that of
Phrantzes and is that during the whole of the 27th the cannons were discharging
their stone balls: <i>tuto el zorno non feze mai altro che bombardar in le
puovere mure</i>; but on p. 51 he says that Mahomet came before the walls to
begin the general attack at three hours before day on the 29th. Critobulus
makes the general attack begin on the afternoon of the 28th, when the sultan
raised his great standard (Crit. lii. and lv.). Karl Müller, in his excellent notes to
Critobulus, justly remarks that as Barbaro and Phrantzes were in the city their
evidence ought to be preferred to that of Critobulus. They both represent the
final assault as beginning very early in the morning of the 29th. The statements
are reconcilable by supposing that the dispositions for a general attack
began on the Sunday, but that the actual general assault did not take place
until the Tuesday morning. Sad-ud-din says, on the authority of two Turkish
contemporaries, that ‘the great victory was on Tuesday, the fifty-first day from
the commencement of the war’ (p. 34).</p></div>

van Millingen. On the map published by the Greek Syllogos, as well as in
Canon Curtis’s <i>Broken Bits of Byzantium</i>, a small postern is shown in the
wall immediately south of the tower adjoining Tekfour Serai, and my own
recollection is that I saw this walled-up postern with Dr. Paspates in 1875. The
wall itself was pulled down on the outbreak of the last Turko-Russian war
and replaced by a slighter one. Whichever view be correct, the statement in
the text is not affected.
</p>
<p>
Professor van Millingen contends that the Kerkoporta strictly so called was
the small gate in the corner between Tekfour Serai and the adjoining tower on
the south. But he maintains also that the postern to which Ducas refers was
in the transverse wall, giving access from the city to the Inner Enclosure. He
remarks that if the Turks entered by the Kerkoporta they could have mounted
the great Inner Wall from the city. As to the latter objection, it must be
remembered that the fighters were within the Enclosure defending the Outer
Wall, and if the Turks entered through the postern in the transverse wall they
would take the fighters in the rear. It would have been a better position for
attack than on the Inner Wall.</p></div>

while ‘the blind-hearted emperor’ was busy resisting the besiegers of the city
at his palace to the north of the Adrianople Gate,’ ‘suddenly he became aware
that the upraisers of the most glorious standard of “The Word of God” had
found a path to within the walls’ (Sad-ud-din, p. 30). The statement that the
emperor was present at Tekfour Serai agrees with that of Ducas; but the latter’s
account of the events immediately following the entry by the Kerkoporta varies
so much from that given by others that I suspect some sentences have dropped
out of his narrative.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_427_427" id="Footnote_427_427"></a><a href="#FNanchor_427_427"><span class="label">427</span></a> It is difficult to identify the gate described as having been opened on to
the stockade. Critobulus gives no further indication of its position than that
here mentioned (ch. lx.). Paspates thinks it was a temporary postern, walled up
after the siege when the Inner Wall was repaired to prevent smuggling, but
would place it not far from Top Capou, a position which cannot be accepted if
the stockade were, as I have placed it, near the Military Gate of St. Romanus.
The Podestà of Pera, however, says that Justiniani went ‘per ipsam portam per
quam Teucri intraverunt’ (p. 648), which would indicate St. Romanus. Andrea
Cambini, the Florentine already quoted, in his <i>Libro della Origine de Turchi</i>,
published by the sons of the writer, says that Justiniani, who had behaved so well
that the salvation of the city was largely attributed to him, was seriously wounded,
and, seeing that the blood flowed ‘in great quantity’ and being unwilling that
they should fetch a doctor, withdrew secretly from the fight ... all the gates
which led from the Antimuro [i.e. the Outer Wall] being closed, because thus
the fighters had to conquer or die (p. 25).</p></div>

an epitaph which contains the phrase ‘lethale vulnere ictus interiit.’ Phrantzes
says that Justiniani was wounded in the right foot by an arrow; Leonard, by an
arrow in the armpit; Chalcondylas, in the hand, by a ball; Critobulus, by a ball
in the chest or throat which pierced through his breastplate. The latter
statement would be consistent with Tetaldi’s which speaks of the wound
inflicted by a culverin. Riccherio says Justiniani was wounded by one of his
own men. Barbaro (who, it must always be remembered where he is speaking
of the Genoese, was a Venetian and incapable of doing justice to a citizen of
the rival republic) does not mention any wound, but states roundly that
Justiniani decided to abandon his post and hasten to his ship, which was
stationed at the boom.</p></div>

that Justiniani and his men deserted their stations and that thus the city
was lost (pp. 675–6). Riccherio, while speaking of the wound as severe,
declares that Justiniani promised to return, and attributes the departure of
many of his followers to the fact that the postern gate, which he had required
to be opened for his departure, suggested the idea of flight to his men. In
other words it created a panic (p. 960). The contemporaries who excuse Justiniani
are Cardinal Isidore (<i>Lamentatio</i>, p. 677: ‘Ne caeteros deterreret,
remedium quaerens clam sese pugnae subduxit’) and Leonard, who both state
that he went away secretly so as not to discourage his followers. Tetaldi further
declares that he left his command to two Genoese. Leonard and the Podestà
wrote while the impression of the fall and the sack of the city were too recent
to enable them to give a cool judgment on Justiniani’s conduct: the latter
dating his letter June 23, and the archbishop August 16.</p></div>

Phrantzes says that possession of the city was obtained at half past two, which
by the then and present prevalent mode in the East of reckoning time would
correspond to about ten. Possession of the city would probably be about three

M. Mijatovich is mistaken in stating (in <i>Constantine, last Emperor of the

government provides oil for the lamp over his grave. Alongside the alleged
grave of Constantine is that of some one else, probably a dervish, and a lamp
was burnt there some years ago. Similar lamps are burnt nightly in many
other places in Constantinople. It is now entirely neglected. Dr. Paspates
suggests, and probably with truth, that the whole story grew out of the desire
for custom by the owner of a neighbouring coffee-house.</p></div>

pointed out, in the <i>Fall of Constantinople</i>, that the system of ex-territoriality,
under which, in virtue of capitulations, foreigners resident in Turkey are
always under the protection of their own laws, is the survival of the system
once general in the Roman empire. Of course it is ridiculous to speak of the
capitulations as having been wrongfully wrung from the Turks by Western
nations, and equally absurd to claim that their grant shows the far-reaching
policy of the Turks in their desire to attract foreign trade. The Turks found
the system of ex-territoriality in full force and maintained it, being unwilling,
as they still are, to allow Christians, whether their own subjects or foreigners,
to rank on an equality with Moslems.</p></div>

‘the two utter walls with the whole space between them are now but slenderly
maintained by the Turks, lying full of earth and other rubbish’ (Knolles’s

entirely disappeared except as to the lower portion, which forms one of the sides
of the foss. In the Lycus valley, and even throughout the whole length of the
landward walls, I think it is manifest to an observer that only the Inner Wall

years ago, in travelling among the mountains of Bithynia, I came on Easter
Monday to a Greek village, far remote from any other, and away from all lines
of communication, where they were performing a miracle-play. The villagers,
dressed in their best, were all present as actors or spectators. The play itself
was a curious mixture of incidents in the life of Christ and of others&mdash;and
these formed the largest part&mdash;from Greek mythology. No one knew anything
of its origin, and all the information obtainable was that the play had always
been performed on Easter Monday.</p></div>

to that of the Gentiles (Leo Allatius). (2) Paul II. accused the principal

Athos during the Greek revolution, found the rolls very convenient for making
haversacks. The books have perished mostly from neglect. The discovery by
the present bishop of Ismidt of the <i>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</i> (Διδαχὴ τῶν δώδεκα ἀποστόλων)

bound up with other manuscripts, the first of which only was indexed, gives
hope that others of value may yet be found. The same remark applies to the

<p><a name="Footnote_560_560" id="Footnote_560_560"></a><a href="#FNanchor_560_560"><span class="label">560</span></a> The influence of Byzantine art upon the West does not fall within the
limits of my task. But every one interested in the subject is aware that during
some centuries its influence was dominant. In the composition of pictures as
well as in their drawing and treatment Western artists for a long time copied
those of Constantinople. In painting, Byzantine influence prevailed throughout
Italy from Justinian to the middle of the fourteenth century. Giotto, who died
in 1336, was, says Kugler, the first to abandon the Byzantine style. In the
intervening centuries the monasteries of Constantinople, Salonica, and Mount
Athos were the central <i>ateliers</i> of painting, and furnished the models for
artistic activity to all Europe. The mosaics in the church of San Vitale at
Ravenna are magnificent illustrations of what Byzantine art was in the time
of Justinian. Those in Hagia Sophia, as well as its general plan of colour-ornamentation,
are still unsurpassed. Those of the Kahrié Mosque belonging
to the fourteenth century are interesting and show a deep feeling for colour-combination
as well as accuracy of drawing. Byzantine architecture in like
manner greatly influenced the builders of churches in Western lands. The
front view of St. Mark’s in Venice in the thirteenth century placed side by side
with that of the Kahrié Mosque at the present day shows that the plan of the
earlier one was familiar to the architect of the other, and, as has been pointed
out by an architect who has made a careful study of the two buildings, when
St. Mark’s differs from the Kahrié, the difference may be found in details
reproduced from another church in Constantinople, that of the Pantocrator.
The resemblance between St. Mark’s and the Kahrié illustrates Mr. Fergusson’s
observations on the decoration of the exteriors of Byzantine churches. He
points out that while the interior of Hagia Sophia is ‘the most perfect and
most beautiful church which has yet been erected by any Christian people,’
the exterior was never finished (Fergusson’s <i>History of Architecture</i>, ii. 321).
The Kahrié of to-day resembles St. Mark’s of the thirteenth century before
the exterior casing was added to it.

The question of the influence of Byzantine art and architecture on the
West has often been dealt with. For a list of books on the subject see Karl
Krumbacher’s <i>Geschichte der byzantinischen Litteratur</i>, pp. 1124–27.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_564_564" id="Footnote_564_564"></a><a href="#FNanchor_564_564"><span class="label">564</span></a> One of the best illustrations of the degraded position assigned to woman
in Mahometan countries is found in the fact that the popular belief is that she
has no soul. The influence of such a belief is of course fatal to the progress
of the race. I am well aware that Khaireddin Pasha and other progressive
Mahometans have maintained that this belief is contrary to the teaching of
the Koran, and that Mr. Hughes and other well-informed students of the sacred
writings of Islam agree in this opinion. Still, my statement as to the popular
belief is not affected by these researches into the original teaching. It is not
alleged that the houris of Paradise are the representatives of earthly women.
The sensual rewards promised to faithful men are clear and unmistakeable.
The rewards to women in the Koran have to be searched for and are the result
of interpretation. As a confirmation of the truth of my statement I may refer
to the interesting interview given by Sir Edward Malet in <i>Shifting Scenes</i>
(1901), p. 67. He describes a meeting which he had with Tewfik, the
Khedive of Egypt, at a very critical moment, when indeed the latter’s life was
in hourly danger. He represents Tewfik as saying: ‘Death does not signify to
me personally. Our religion prevents us from having any fear of death; but
it is different with our women. To them, you know, life is everything: their
existence ends here; they cry and weep and implore me to save them.’
</p>
<p>
As to the custom of repudiating a wife, two learned Moslems, one Turkish
and the other Indian, and both enlightened men, assure me that repudiation,
though a general custom, is contrary to the teaching of Islam, which only
recognises divorce. Both, however, admit that the practice is general, though
they consider it irreligious or&mdash;what is the same thing in the Sacred Law of
Islam&mdash;illegal.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_565_565" id="Footnote_565_565"></a><a href="#FNanchor_565_565"><span class="label">565</span></a> I may add here that the great value of Christian missions from the West
in the Turkish Empire, those of the Latin Church and of the American
Protestant Churches alike, lies not only in their educational work but still more
in their holding up to the members of the Eastern Churches higher standards
of truthfulness and morality. Their influence has been already very useful.
They have kindled a desire for instruction, and have infused new life in many of
the members of the ancient Churches. While Greeks, Bulgarians, and Armenians
look with intense distrust on any attempts to proselytise, they have all been
awakened by these missions to the necessity for education. Considering the
means at their disposal, I think it may be fairly said that no other people
during the last half-century has done so much for education as the Greeks. The
desire of every Greek who makes money seems to be to found a school in his
native place. In Constantinople several large and excellent institutions, both
for boys and girls, exist, all of course unaided by the Government, and in other
cities of the Turkish empire like efforts have been made by patriotic Greeks.
In Bulgaria one of the first acts of the newly enfranchised state was to
establish an efficient system of education. The Armenians are not behind
either, and their efforts, perhaps to a greater extent than those of the other two
peoples mentioned, are directed to bringing their priests into line with those
of the West. In 1896 the American missionaries in Turkey met in a ‘summer
school’ on the island of Proti, near Constantinople; the late Armenian
patriarch visited them, and, having spent a day in listening to their discussion
on questions of teaching and Biblical scholarship, declared that he would be
ready to sacrifice his life if his own priests could have the advantage of such
gatherings.</p></div>

approximate length of a stadium: <i>e.g.</i> Chalcondylas says that the walls of
Constantinople were 111 stadia, or a little over 13 English miles, in circuit.
Critobulus gives the total length of walls as 126 stadia and the length of
the landward walls as 48. Both his figures are somewhat too high, unless they
are intended to give the measure of the sinuosities of the walls. But the
statements both of Chalcondylas and Critobulus as well as that of Leonard, if
his intention is to represent a measure about a ninth or tenth of a furlong, are
all pretty nearly accurate.</p></div>
